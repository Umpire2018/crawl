The parliamentary election campaign, initially offering a glimmer of political change, nevertheless saw Aliyev's ruling New Azerbaijan Party retaining a majority of deputy seats. From 2020, Aliyev endured the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Azerbaijan, where a series of controversial anti-lockdown laws were introduced that allowed for the Azerbaijani government to crackdown on political opposition and silence anti-government critics over the country's response to the pandemic, which Aliyev referred to as a \"fifth column\" attempting to \"destroy Azerbaijan\". The Azerbaijani government also introduced a series of anti-crisis packages that were aimed at relieving the economic impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to which the emergency aid was later criticized for allegedly having citizens struggling to obtain it.",

The timing of election was also noted by ''Associated Press'' to have coincided ahead of the 2024 Russian presidential election, for which the alleged reason was due to attempts by Aliyev to minimize Russia's influence on the Azerbaijani election. Opposition leader Ali Karimli assessed that a snap presidential election indicated Aliyev's desire to hold polls \"in isolation from the democratic world\" and fear of a change in the current \"minimal political competition\", where he speculated that Aliyev wanted to secure another seven-year presidential term before a potential Russian defeat in the Russo-Ukrainian War which could according to his theory \"upend the regional geopolitical situation to authoritarians' disfavor.\" Musavat party chairman Arif Hajili criticized the announcement of a snap presidential election, stating that holding an early vote hinders political competition and that it is problematic for the election campaign. In a following subsequent statement, the Musavat party claimed that the election date in winter will lead to a low voter turnout, accusing Azerbaijani authorities of turning the presidential election into \"a formal procedure\".",
