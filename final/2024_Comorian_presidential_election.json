The opposition candidates shared the slogan \"Azali Nalawe\" (\"Azali, get out\"). Ten days before campaigning began, Harimia Ahmed, the senior Supreme Court magistrate responsible for monitoring the elections, was dismissed through a decree by Assoumani.",

Salim Issa Adillah, the second-placer in the vote, warned that the opposition had \"an action plan that we will roll out at the right moment\".

Police responded by firing tear gas and making arrests, with reports that security forces opened fire on a women's march. A government spokesman accused the opposition of organising the protests, while opposition candidate {{ill|Mohamed Daoudou|fr}} expressed solidarity with what he called a \"spontaneous movement\".
