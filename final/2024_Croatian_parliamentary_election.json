The coalition will also contest the 2024 European Parliament elections. Two more liberal parties, Focus (Croatian political party)|Focus and the People's Party – Reformists announced their cooperation on 10 November 2023. The leader of the Reformists Radimir Čačić said that with a high level of certainty they expect a large expansion of this cooperation with parties close to them, who believe that Croatia is institutionally and as a society trapped by the HDZ, and that this should be stopped and space should be opened for a different, much more modern, more liberal Croatia. Finally two groups made one single alliance on 9 December 2023. Four party leaders: Davor Nađi (Focus), Dalibor Paus (IDS), Radimir Čačić (NS-R) and Darijo Vasilić (PGS) pointed out that they are running against the HDZ and that after the elections they will not participate in the government with the HDZ, although Čačić did not rule out the possibility of supporting a minority government. On 5 March 2024, the coalition was formally constituted under the name \"For Better Croatia\". The coalition later collapsed after Focus decided to ally with the Republic (Croatian political party)|Republic party of Damir Vanđelić, while the Reformists still partnered with IDS and PGS in VII. and VIII constituencies and with the Restart Coalition|Rivers of Justice coalition in other constutuencues.",

He also compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to Croatian War of Independence|Serbian aggression against Croatia in the 1990s. The numerous political corruption scandals within the government have weakened the HDZ campaign. Some thirty ministers have had to leave the government in eight years because of corruption. The scandal involving private WhatsApp messages of former HDZ official Josipa Rimac with the new State's Attorney Office of the Republic of Croatia|State Attorney of Croatia Ivan Turudić, that were one of the causes of the 2024 Zagreb protest, continued during the campaign and this time involved the HDZ Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure (Croatia)|Minister of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure Oleg Butković. In April, several previously unreleased sets of leaked messages were published by Faktograf.hr that apparently testify to some dubious actions and deal-making by Rimac, involving suspicions of lobbying, influence peddling and nepotism. Butković denied remembering contacts with Rimac. In the messages, Rimac also criticized the former Conflict of Interest Commission presidents Nataša Novaković and Dalija Orešković.",

Peđa Grbin challenged Andrej Plenković to one, but Plenković refused to debate Grbin, as the PM candidate of Rivers of Justice is Zoran Milanović. The Prime Minister of Croatia|Prime Minister refused to debate other political opponents, saying that he doesn't have anyone to debate with. DP leader Ivan Penava and PM candidates Nikola Grmoja (Most) and Sandra Benčić (Možemo!) also challenged Plenković to a debate. Grbin, Grmoja and Benčić all suggested Plenković is afraid and/or called him a coward. To the calls to debate them, Plenković responded by saying: \"This is a political match in which Grbin capitulated before the formal campaign, Milanović violates the Constitution, and a political trifle, like Most, is not someone we would confront (in a debate).\" Plenković, Grbin and Penava all skipped the big HRT debate, while Grmoja and Benčić attended.",
