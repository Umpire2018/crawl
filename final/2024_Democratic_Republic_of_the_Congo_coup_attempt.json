After Christian Malanga and another deceased person were removed from the list, a televised court-martial for the remaining 51 suspects, including Marcel Malanga, Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, and Tyler Thompson, began at the Ndolo military prison in Kinshasa on 7 June. During the course of the trial, Marcel Malanga and Benjamin Zalman-Polun said that they had been coerced by Christian Malanga to participate in the coup, adding that the latter had threatened to kill them. Human Rights Watch criticised the inclusion of Jean-Jacques Wondo, a Belgian-Congolese researcher on political and security issues, as a defendant in the case, saying that the grounds for the charges against him appeared to be a photograph of him and Christian Malanga that was taken in 2016.",

However, prosecutors spared one defendant who was suffering from \"psychological problems\". The court issued its verdict on 13 September, and sentenced 37 defendants to death, including Marcel Malanga, Zalman-Polun, Thompson, Wondo, a British national of Congolese origin, and a Canadian national of Congolese origin. The remaining 14 defendants were acquitted. The convicted were also ordered to pay more than 145 billion Congolese francs ($50 million) in damages to the Congolese state.
