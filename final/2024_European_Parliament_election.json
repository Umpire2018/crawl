In 2014, the candidate of the largest group, Jean-Claude Juncker, was eventually nominated and elected as Commission President.

In the aftermath of the election List of German defence ministers|German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen was chosen as Commission President, even though she had not been a candidate prior to the election, while Manfred Weber, lead candidate for the EPP, which had gained the most seats, was not nominated as he was unable to secure support from any other party. Following this appointment of a Commission President who had not been a Spitzenkandidat, some called for the system to be abandoned, while others called for it to be revived in the 2024 elections.",

During the 6–7 April 2024 campaign launch event in Brussels the party elected German MEP Damian Boeselager and Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld as its lead candidates. Regarding which European Parliament group to join after the elections, Boeselager said he was “''open to discussions''” between remaining in Greens–European Free Alliance|Greens/EFA or joining Renew Europe in due course. To emphasise its demand for transnational lists, Volt Europa also presented a symbolic transnational list for the election alongside its leading candidates.",

This would have meant that European Union leaders would potentially discuss his successor in the summer as, if elected to the European Parliament, he would have had to step down because of prohibition of the dual mandate. His mandate had been to set to expire in November 2024. For this unanticipated decision Michel was criticised by EU officials and diplomats. He was criticised by his political ally Sophie in 't Veld who questioned his \"credibility\". This timing was further criticised for potential disruptions it could cause, as Article 2(4) of the European Council's Rules of Procedure provide that, if its President leaves office early, he \"shall be replaced, where necessary until the election of his or her successor, by the member of the European Council representing the Member State holding the six-monthly Presidency of the Council\". This would have been the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose country would be scheduled to take over the rotating presidency of the European Council on 1 July. On 26 January 2024, Michel withdrew his candidacy and thus delayed his departure.",
