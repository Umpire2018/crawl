The seat total here reflects the inclusion of two candidates elected under the SOC code associated with the PS, but is not inclusive of the generic ECO code attributed to miscellaneous ecologist candidates including Delphine Batho who was officially supported by the New Popular Front, and both this tally and those compiled by other sources may not fully account for all regionalist (REG) or miscellaneous left (DVG) candidates who claim to have the NFP's support, particularly those in overseas France. but 134 NFP and 82 Ensemble candidates withdrew despite qualifying for the run-off in order to reduce the RN's chances of winning an absolute majority of seats.",

Those remarks were followed by Tondelier declaring that Mélenchon would not be prime minister, and that any prime minister would have to be chosen by consensus between the forces of the New Popular Front, but she was almost immediately rebuked by LFI national coordinator Manuel Bompard, who argued that \"nobody can decide to exclude\" Mélenchon. In back-to-back evening interviews on France 2, Place Publique co-founder and MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, echoed Tondelier's comments in declaring definitively that \"Mélenchon will not be prime minister,\" even as Mélenchon told Hollande to \"shut up\" in response to his comments the previous day, complained that the speculation was due to \"jealousy\" of others on the left, and lamented the fact that he had to cede 100 additional constituencies to PS candidates compared to the New Ecological and Social People's Union (NUPES) in 2022 because Glucksmann's Party-list proportional representation|list outpolled the LFI list in the preceding European elections. Interviewed on 26 June, Faure said Mélenchon would not be prime minister, and the latter chided his alliance partners' \"petty\" bickering and reaffirmed that any decisions about who would become prime minister would only be made after the elections, but did not close the door to the possibility of him seeking the post, saying \"there are those who don't like me and others who do like me.\" On 1 July, LFI deputy Sophia Chikirou declared that \"it will be either Mélenchon at Matignon, or another\" LFI member if they constitute a majority of left-of-centre elected officials, owing to her feeling that other members of the alliance were indebted to them.",
