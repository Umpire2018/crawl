The ruling was controversial as the court chief justice, Anwar Usman, is Gibran's uncle. Anwar Usman was ultimately demoted by the ''Majelis Kehormatan Mahkamah Konstitusi'' or the Honorary Council of the Constitutional Court from the position of Chief Justice on 8 November after finding him guilty of conflict of interest on the ruling. Furthermore, the KPU was found to have committed ethics violations surrounding Gibran's vice presidential registration for allowing him to register his candidacy before the commission had adjusted the age minimum for candidates in its internal regulation. A lawsuit was filed by the Indonesian Democracy Defenders (TPDI) and the Indonesian Advocates Movement (Perekat Nusantara) against Joko Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming, Anwar Usman and First Lady Iriana alleging nepotism and political dynasty on the part of the respondents, but was dismissed by the Jakarta State Administrative Court a day before the election.\n<!-- Commented out until a proper section is written",

Polling stations are intended to receive their ballots the day before voting, although more isolated regions began distribution earlier. To reach more isolated polling stations, helicopters, boats, and animal-drawn carts were employed. KPU intends for each polling station to serve a maximum of 300 voters, although regulations allow for a maximum of 500. According to Hasyim Asyari, this was due to the time constraints at each polling station. Each polling station has four voting booths.",

Due to concerns over deaths of KPPS staff in the 2019 Indonesian general election|2019 election, KPU added rules in 2024 limiting their age to between 17 and 55, in addition to providing proof of good health. Seven KPPS members are assigned to each polling station, with one serving as the head. KPPS staff are paid Rp 1.1 million to 1.2 million (~USD 70) for their work, double the payment received by KPPS staff in 2019. Vote counting at each polling station occurs between 14 and 15 February, with vote recapitulation being done between 15 February and 20 March at the village/subdistrict, district, and regency/city levels. Each pair of presidential candidates are also allowed a maximum of two witnesses for each polling station. The Indonesian National Police said that 4,992 personnel would be deployed to secure the counting of votes.",
