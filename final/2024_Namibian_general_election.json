Initially scheduled on 27 November 2024, these were later extended in some areas to 30 November due to poor planning.

They were the country's seventh general elections since gaining independence from Union of South Africa|apartheid South Africa in 1990.",

The IPC accused the ECN of \"deliberately suppressing voters and deliberately trying to frustrate voters from casting their vote\". Following complaints from opposition parties, the ECN announced a further extension of voting hours for 29 and 30 November at 36 selected polling locations in Windhoek as well as in the Kunene Region|Kunene, Oshana and Oshikoto Region|Oshikoto regions. Representatives of the IPC, PDM and AR expressed dissatisfaction with the limited selection of polling locations for the voting extension. Legal experts and the IPC have called into question the legality of the voting extension. African Union (AU) election observers criticised the ECN's decision to extend voting for causing confusion. The IPC accused the ECN of \"deliberately trying to dissuade voters from voting\". The AU observer mission gave the ECN a transparency score of just 50%.",
