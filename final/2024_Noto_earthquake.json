This process began during the Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene the tectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision between the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc|Izu–Bonin Arc and Honshu. This led to reactivation of the rift faults in reverse sense, combined with inversion (geology)|inversion of the basins formed by these faults. Currently Japan is situated on the convergent boundary|convergent boundaries between the Pacific, Philippine Sea plate|Philippine Sea, Okhotsk Plate|Okhotsk and Amurian Plates. Along the island arc's east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west coast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north–south trending convergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been proposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-dipping thrust faults.",

He was also criticized for only visiting an evacuation center briefly two weeks after the earthquake. In Wajima, there were over 4,000 registrations for temporary housing units with baths and water heating, of which, only 550 were constructed by mid-February. Only 40 of the 456 temporary housing units in Suzu were completed. Local officials said about 14,000 temporary housing units would be ready by the end of March. Despite reassurance by the government, local residents' confidence remains low due to living conditions in evacuation centers and the delayed response. By the end of February, more than 11,000 people remained in temporary shelters.",
