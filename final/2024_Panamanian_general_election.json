His conviction was upheld by the Panamanian Supreme Court|Supreme Court on 2 February 2024, making him ineligible to run again for president in elections that he wanted to contest later in the year. On 4 March his candidacy was formally revoked by the Electoral Tribunal, which declared his running-mate, former foreign minister José Raúl Mulino, as the replacement presidential candidate in his place without a vice-president. On 3 May, the Supreme Court voted 8–1 to dismiss a legal challenge against Mulino's candidacy on the grounds that he was not selected as candidate in a party primary and lacked a vice-presidential candidate, arguing that to do so would be a greater harm to Realizing Goals and the Alliance Party, which would have been left without a presidential candidate.",
