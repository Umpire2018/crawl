Meanwhile, Ivan Korčok has been supportive of the West and Ukrainian resistance against Russia. During the campaign, Pellegrini accused Korčok of being a warmonger who wants to send troops to Ukraine, which Korčok denied. Pellegrini also said that he was running for president \"to rescue the government of [Prime Minister] Robert Fico.\" Fico also openly supported Pellegrini, calling him a “a moderate candidate who recognises the value of peace\" and described Korčok as supporting \"everything the West tells him without hesitation\". Pellegrini and Fico's accusations were made despite the office of the president not having constitutional powers to deploy military forces abroad.",

He also noted that a majority of voters voted for nationalist candidates and not \"a liberal, progressive\" candidate, and predicted the second round of voting to be a tight race.",
