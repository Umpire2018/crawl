Ntuli defeated the MK Party's premier candidate, Zulu Nation's deputy prime minister Phathisizwe Chiliza, with 41 votes to 39. Ntuli took office and appointed his cabinet on 18 June, making him the first IFP member to serve as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal since 2004.",

The IEC said it had received 579 objections from both voters and political parties regarding the election results, and ordered recounts in 24 cases. Police Minister Bheki Cele warned that authorities would not tolerate \"threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral processes\".",
