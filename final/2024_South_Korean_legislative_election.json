One major talking point was an incident on 18 March when President Yoon visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices and describing the 875-won ($0.65) price of a green onion he found as reasonable, only for it to emerge that the onions were being sold at a discount and that the true price of onions was three to four times higher. The incident led to opposition candidates bringing out green onions at campaign rallies and the hashtag #greenonions875won becoming a trending topic on social media throughout the election. In response, the National Election Commission (South Korea)|National Election Commission banned voters from bringing green onions to polling stations, citing concerns over \"election interference\". This was in turn, widely ridiculed and led to an increase in demand for green onion-themed merchandise.",

In a separate statement, Han Dong-hoon also resigned as head of the People Power Party and took responsibility for its defeat in the election. That same day, Justice Party (South Korea)|Green-Justice leader Sim Sang-jung announced her retirement from politics. Sim, who ran twice for president in 2017 and 2021, was a four-term lawmaker under various minor left-wing parties. In her announcement, Sim assumed responsibility for the party losing all six seats and falling below the 3% required for proportional representation.",

Nevertheless, the election result, and overwhelming majority in favor of the governmental opposition, was enough to effectively block any government plans going into the future. ''The Diplomat (magazine)|The Diplomat'' described Yoon Suk-yeol as a \"lame duck\" for his remaining three years in office. Chae Jin-won of Humanitas College at Kyung Hee University stated that \"If Yoon can't find a way to work with the opposition, there is a likelihood of impeachment, which some factions in the ruling party may comply with for the sake of their own political futures.\"",
