After the 2024 summer, the record high temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean caused unusually high levels of water evaporation, that precipitated with record intensity Cold drop|when it came into contact with high altitude cold air arriving from the north. It made the storm 2 times more likely and the rainfall 12% heavier. Increasing the flood risk, the hotter recent summers made the soil drier,  reducing the ground's ability to soak up water, which facilitates flash flooding. Scientists suggest that climate change may also have caused the storm to move more slowly, creating more rainfall in the same place; the same is said about the central European 2024 Central European floods|storm \"Boris\". The warmer sea waters also increase wind speed during such storms. The Climate change in the Arctic|warming of the Arctic makes the jet stream weaker, which facilitated the movement of cold arctic air further south, as occurred in this instance, when a pocket of cold air from over Greenland penetrated the warm air mass over Spain. When the cold air from the north meets the warm humid air from over the sea, it creates intense rainfall and strong winds. Climate change warming has also extended the season in which this Cold drop|DANA phenomena can occur: from only November, to anytime in the year.",

The Military Emergencies Unit deployed to Valencia to aid rescue efforts. Emergency responders needed helicopters to lift residents in Álora, Andalusia trapped by a nearby swollen river. King Felipe VI expressed his \"desolation and concern at the tragedy\" and \"together with the Queen, we wish to send our condolences to all the families affected who have lost loved ones and who still do not know what happened to their relatives\" and held a video conference with the Military Emergency Unit. On 31 October, the King offered the Royal Guard (Spain)|Royal Guard and the Royal Household Security Service to the competent authorities to assist with the tragedy. Specifically, 195 royal guards and fifty civil guards with different specialties (divers, dog handlers and drone pilots, among others) were deployed. Three days of mourning were declared nationwide, from 31 October to 2 November. At the same time, over 30 October and 1 November, about 1,000 Spanish troops gradually deployed to the worst impacted areas. During the first 48 hours of the response, the military rescued 4,800 people and provided aid to 30,000 more. On 2 November, Sánchez deployed {{val|10000}} troops of the Spanish Army to the Valencian Community, in the largest peacetime military deployment in Spanish history.",
