The government was criticized for the catastrophic state of the economy and its inaction, which led in particular to the worsening of the health crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic in Tunisia|COVID-19 pandemic. That same evening, invoking Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution of 2014|2014 Constitution, Kais Saied dismissed the Mechichi Cabinet with immediate effect, in particular Hichem Mechichi from his duties as head of government and interim Minister of the Interior, announced the suspension of the assembly (whose members he lifted their immunity), the formation of a new government (which would be accountable to him) and his decision to govern by decree; he also indicated that he would chair the prosecution.

The other candidates saw their applications rejected, generally for a lack of sponsorships. Many of them and those who had given up running were prosecuted for suspicion of false sponsorships. On 2 September, the electoral authority confirmed the validation of the three applications, three other applications, those of Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif Mekki and Imed Daïmi, who had been reinstated by the Administrative Court, were however rejected. This decision is however contrary to the Constitution, which stipulates that the decisions of the Administrative Court cannot be appealed and that the role of the Independent High Authority for Elections is only technical. The president of the ISIE claimed that the Administrative Court is not competent and accused the latter of failing to notify them of the decision to reinstate the candidates, which the Administrative Court denied. The decision was denounced by the Tunisian General Labour Union and Human Rights Watch.",
