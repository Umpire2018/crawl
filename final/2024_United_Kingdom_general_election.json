Key topics were the cost of living crisis, the National Health Service (NHS), young people, education, immigration and tax policy. Sunak said that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax, which Starmer denied. Sunak said this figure was calculated by \"independent Treasury officials\". Fact checkers disputed the sum, stating it was based on assumptions made by political appointees and that the figure was over a 4-year period. On 5 June, the BBC reported that James Bowler (civil servant)|James Bowler, the Treasury permanent secretary, wrote that \"civil servants were not involved in the [...] calculation of the total figure used\" and that \"any costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service\". The Office for Statistics Regulation also criticised the claim on the grounds that it was presented without the listener knowing it was a sum over 4 years. A YouGov snap poll after the debate indicated that 46% of debate viewers thought Sunak had performed better, and 45% believed Starmer had performed better. A Savanta poll published the next day favoured Starmer 44% to Sunak 39%. The debate was watched by 5.37 million viewers, making it the most-viewed programme of the week.",
