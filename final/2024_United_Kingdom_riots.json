Several vehicles close to Stechford police station were attacked amid the protest. A Sky News crew was followed by a man in a balaclava wielding a knife who slashed their van's tyre. Before this, the Sky News broadcast from the scene was interrupted by a small group of these protesters, with one shouting \"free Palestine\" and \"fuck the EDL\". The ''Birmingham Mail'' reported that video footage of the incident shows it starting with words being exchanged before one member of the group starts assaulting the man. Others then join in the beating while some try to break up the attack. Sky News' Midlands correspondent Becky Cotterill posted to X the next day that the manager of the pub had told her the man had goaded his attackers by using offensive language as they walked past. He was barred from the pub for \"inciting violence.\"",

Over 2,000 people attended a counter-protest in Old Market, Bristol, where scenes were mostly peaceful despite one arrest after a bottle and a brick were thrown at a police vehicle. Around 500 anti-racist counter-protesters gathered in Westcliff-on-Sea, Southend, to oppose an expected far-right protest that did not materialise. One individual in the area was arrested by police on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon. Hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter following reports a refugee and migrant centre would be the target of a far-right protest. Around 600 people gathered at Magdalen Road in Oxford over fears that a mosque would be targeted. Counter-protests occurred elsewhere in the country, including Normanton, Derby, Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle, Sheffield and Swindon. Smaller gatherings were also present in Accrington and Tamworth, the latter being only a few miles from a hotel which was attacked on 4 August.",
