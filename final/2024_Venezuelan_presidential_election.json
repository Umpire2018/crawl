In many of the consulates, delays were observed and the CNE registered little political interest in solving the problem; the majority of voters abroad register an opposition tendency. David Smolansky, former mayor of El Hatillo Municipality|El Hatillo, accused the administration of blocking the registration of at least 4.5 million Venezuelans abroad through \"a policy of systematic and generalized discrimination\" as well as its \"requirements to register and change residence address\" that led to \"queues at the consulates\".",
