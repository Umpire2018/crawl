The landslides were caused by heavy rains that caused hillsides to collapse, destroying the areas below. The disaster was one of the deadliest in Kerala's history, with reports of 254 fatalities, 397 injuries, and 118 people missing. Deforestation, seismic sensitivity, poor building construction, and global warming have been identified as possible causes for the landslides and fatalities.",

Located in the Western Ghats mountain range, its hills consist of Fault (geology)|faulted and Erosion|eroded mountain edges of the Deccan Plateau. Geological evidence suggests that this region was shaped during the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. As a result of this breakup, the Deccan Plateau was formed from basalt rocks, leading to the rise of the Western Ghats. Geophysics|Geophysical data indicates that the mountainous area of Wayanad emerged along the west coast of India during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous periods when India separated from the African continent. The Iruvanjippuzha and Chaliyar rivers, both originating in the Western Ghats, flow westward towards the Arabian Sea due to the steep gradient from east to west. Numerous smaller streams drain the region into these rivers, often carrying a substantial volume of water during the monsoon months. According to Meppadi government disaster mitigation documents prepared in 2020, the villages of Mundakkai, Wayanad|Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Puthumala, Attamala, Vellithodu, Thrikkaipatta|Thrikkaippatta, and Kottatharavayal are highly sensitive to landslides and flash floods.",

The Indian Army withdrew partially from search operations and handed over further activities to the NDRF, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), firefighters, and the Kerala police. A small contingent remained in the area to maintain the temporary bridge and to assist with search operations. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan requested that volunteers avoid sending provisions, clothes, vegetables or confectionery to the disaster zone, instead to provide financial contributions for rehabilitation as nearly 400 truckloads of relief materials was in surplus. The State government began to allow survivors and next-of-kin of the missing or dead to take part in the final search operation between 06:00 and 11:00 IST on 9 August, along with disaster management authorities and medical teams. The Indian Army's K-9 Dog Squad also ended their search and rescue operations and exited Wayanad's landslide zone. A holiday was declared for all schools and colleges in the affected area after a booming sound caused anxiety among the locals. The state government initiated massive waste management efforts, and cleared over 150 tonnes of waste. Three dead bodies and one body part was found and then airlifted from near Kanthanpara Waterfalls. More than 700 documents such as revenue certificates, land ownership certificates, ration cards, and house ownership documents were distributed to affected families.",

The high court wanted to look for the legal framework to control illegal mining and floodings. Meanwhile, Kasaragod resident advocate C Shukur submitted another writ petition and demanded the high court stop the collection of money without prior permission from the government and to stop misuse or mismanagement of funds during disasters that could occur due to lack of transparency, poor oversight, corruption, and insufficient oversight mechanisms. Later, the Kerala High Court dismissed the writ petition alleging relief funds being collected on political or religious grounds. The court also imposed costs of {{INRConvert|25|k}} to be paid to the Chief Minister's Disaster Relief Fund on the petitioner.",

Most of these unauthorized establishments lacked licenses from local bodies or the District Tourism Promotion Council. According to the Department of Tourism, only 32 such villas or resorts were registered with government, but more than 3,000 such establishments could be found online in the Wayanad district alone. These properties did not pay taxes, and did not follow any norms of the State Pollution Control Board or forest department. Authorities have started taking action against them. A report submitted by the district town planner to District Disaster Management Authority on 27 September indicated that several resorts located in the landslide-prone zones of the eastern slope of the Western Ghats violated all norms and regulations. The Fire and Rescue Department reported that several glass bridges in resorts operate without approvals from any department.",
