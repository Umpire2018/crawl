The parliamentary opposition under the [[Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance]] (INDIA) tabled a no confidence motion about the crisis on 10 August in order to make Modi address the situation in more detail to parliament.

Afterwards, Modi addressed the conflict, stating that "there would soon be peace in Manipur" and that the whole country would get behind resolution efforts.

Critics and local activists argue that the conflict in Manipur has been strategically manufactured by central authorities through classic divide and rule tactics. Voices on the ground contend that biased security deployments, inflammatory political rhetoric, and policies that obscure transparency have all contributed to an environment of perpetual instability. Scholars, among others, asserts that such measures are part of a broader “divide et impera” strategy designed to prevent any cohesive push for genuine regional autonomy. According to these allegations, maintaining internal divisions not only weakens calls for self-governance but also ensures that Manipur remains dependent on and subservient to central power.<ref>{{Cite web |last=TEREM |first=LEISHILEMBI |date=2025-03-08 |title=A Manufactured Conflict: The Structural Logic of India's Role in the Manipur Ethnic Violence » Imphal Review of Arts and Politics |url=https://imphalreviews.in/a-manufactured-conflict-the-structural-logic-of-indias-role-in-the-manipur-ethnic-violence/#google_vignette |access-date=2025-03-28 |website=imphalreviews.in |language=en-GB}}</ref>
