==Relief==
The cold came while Afghanistan was experiencing a [[famine]] that affected more than half of the Afghan population. The country had become a [[pariah state]] following the [[2021 Taliban offensive]] and the reestablishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, leading to limited [[foreign aid]].<ref name="AJ" />

Humanitarian relief efforts provided aid that included heating and relief funds.<ref name=":0" /> Foreign relief efforts were complicated by a ban on women providing [[humanitarian aid]]. These restrictions were relaxed for health-related aid on January 17, so [[non-governmental organization]]s such as the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Save the Children]], and [[Care International]] resumed operations.<ref name="AJ" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=17 January 2023 |title=NGOs resume some Afghan operations with women workers |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/17/ngos-resume-some-operations-with-women-in-afghanistan |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=[[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] |language=en}}</ref> Supreme leader [[Hibatullah Akhundzada]] stated that the restrictions would not be repealed.<ref name="BBC" />

Military helicopters were used to provide relief for citizens cut off by snow, but they were unable to access Afghanistan's mountainous regions.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite web |last=Doucet |first=Lyse |date=24 January 2023 |title=Afghanistan: Freezing weather kills at least 124 people |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64386145 |work=[[BBC]] |place=[[Kabul]]}}</ref>
