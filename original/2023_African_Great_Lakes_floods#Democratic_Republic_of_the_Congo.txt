Frequent heavy rains causing damage and casualties between March and May are common in [[East Africa]] – in May 2020 around 80 people were killed by floods in [[Rwanda]].

In 2023, several rounds of heavy rain saturated the ground, increasing the likelihood of flooding. Between January and April 2023, the Ministry of Emergency Management reported that weather-related disasters caused 60 fatalities, destroyed over 1,205 homes and damaged 5,000 acres of land across Rwanda.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=3 May 2023 |title=Floods from heavy rainfall kill at least 129 in Rwanda |url=https://apnews.com/article/rwanda-deadly-floods-109-killed-868f117db85661a73f6d0f532e2b8451 |website=[[Associated Press]]|first=Ignatius|last=Ssuuna |language=en}}</ref> On 2 May, the Rwanda Meteorology Agency predicted above-average forecast rainfall for the next 10 days.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Nkurunziza |first=Michel |date=3 May 2023 |title=Over 100 dead as rain ravages Northern, Western provinces |url=https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/7168/news/environment/over-100-dead-as-rain-ravages-northern-western-provinces |website=The New Times |language=en}}</ref>
