On 19 September 2023, a series of protests began in [[Armenia]] following a [[2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh |military offensive]] launched by [[Azerbaijan]] in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which resulted in a swift Azerbaijani victory over the ethnic Armenian breakaway republic of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]]. The republic had been heavily backed by Armenia until a change in Prime Minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]]'s policy towards the region in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mejlumyan |first=Ani |date=16 April 2022 |title=Officials In Karabakh Break With Armenia Over Negotiations |url=https://www.eurasiareview.com/16042022-officials-in-karabakh-break-with-armenia-over-negotiations/ |website=Eurasia Review}}</ref> The government of Azerbaijan compelled the separatist authorities in Artsakh to surrender, disband the [[Artsakh Defence Army]] and begin negotiations regarding their reintegration within Azerbaijan.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gigova |first=Tim Lister,Anna Chernova,Christian Edwards,Radina |date=2023-09-20 |title=Azerbaijan says it has retaken breakaway Armenian enclave after separatists surrender |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/asia/nagorno-karabakh-russia-ceasefire-intl/index.html |access-date=2023-09-25 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> In response, protests erupted in Armenia accusing Pashinyan of mismanaging the crisis and abandoning Artsakh, demanding that he step down.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-09-20 |title=Armenia protests follow Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66870061 |access-date=2023-09-25}}</ref> Pashinyan has characterized the protests as an attempt to unlawfully remove him from power. 

The [[pro-Western]] [[National Democratic Pole|National Democratic Alliance]] blamed the situation on Russia's failure to intervene, while members of the pro-Russian political opposition blamed Pashinyan for the defeat and accused him of betraying Nagorno-Karabakh's residents "in favor of the interests of the West."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ponomarev|first=Kirill|title=Nagorno-Karabakh Crisis Deepens Divides in Armenia Toward Russia|work=Moscow Times|date=28 September 2023|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/09/28/nagorno-karabakh-crisis-deepens-divides-in-armenia-toward-russia-a82586|access-date=29 September 2023|archive-date=29 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929043604/https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/09/28/nagorno-karabakh-crisis-deepens-divides-in-armenia-toward-russia-a82586|url-status=live}}</ref> On 3 October, the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] voted 60-22 in favor of ratifying the [[Rome Statute]], which would enable Armenia to join the [[International Criminal Court]].

==Background==
The [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] was an ethnically Armenian-majority [[Autonomous oblasts of the Soviet Union|autonomous oblast]] within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]], itself a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. Karabakh Armenians remained outside of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]] and resented incorporation into Soviet Azerbaijan on account of historical enmity between the two peoples and discriminatory policies.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Starovoytova |first=Galina |date=5 September 2015 |title=Sovereignty After Empire: Self-Determination Movements in the Former Soviet Union |url=https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/pwks19.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314203423/http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/pwks19.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 March 2016}}</ref> In the late 1980s, the [[Karabakh movement]] developed as a manifestation of the Karabakh Armenians' desire to have their oblast transferred to Soviet Armenian jurisdiction. This culminated in 1991, amidst the ongoing [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|disintegration of the Soviet Union]], when the authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh AO separated from Azerbaijan and declared independence as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (later the Republic of Artsakh). This bid for independence was initially successful; as both Azerbaijan and Armenia declared independence from the USSR, Karabakh Armenian fighters drove out Azerbaijani forces alongside the army of Armenia during the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The end of the war in 1994 left the Karabakh republic internationally unrecognized but victorious, with several areas around the Nagorno-Karabakh region proper occupied as well by troops from Karabakh and Armenia.

Over the following decades, independent Nagorno-Karabakh/Artsakh remained outside Azerbaijani control, heavily reliant on and closely integrated with Armenia, and in many ways functioning as a ''de facto'' part of Armenia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hughes |first=James |title=Ethnicity and Territory in the Former Soviet Union: Regions in Conflict. |publisher=London: Cass. |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-8210-5 |pages=211 |quote=Indeed, Nagorno-Karabakh is de facto part of Armenia.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornell |first=Svante |title=Azerbaijan Since Independence |publisher=New York: M.E. Sharpe |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7656-3004-9 |pages=135 |quote=Following the war, the territories that fell under Armenian control, in particular Mountainous Karabakh itself, were slowly integrated into Armenia. Officially, Karabakh and Armenia remain separate political entities, but for most practical matters the two entities are unified.}}</ref> The situation drastically changed in 2020 during the [[Second Nagorno-Karabakh War]] which resulted in an Azerbaijani victory. Azerbaijan retook the occupied districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh as well as one third of Nagorno-Karabakh itself. [[Peacekeeping operations in Nagorno-Karabakh|Russian peacekeepers]] were deployed to Artsakh as part of a ceasefire agreement.

In September 2023, despite the ongoing presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region, Azerbaijan launched a renewed offensive against Artsakh, emerging victorious after one day and forcing the [[government of Artsakh]] to surrender, disband [[Artsakh Defence Army|their army]], and agree to reintegration talks. Armenia under the government of Nikol Pashinyan refused to intervene in the situation, having previously recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan in a bid to make peace with Armenia's neighbors and orient the country towards the West.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Osborn |first=Andrew |date=2023-09-03 |title=Armenian PM says depending solely on Russia for security was 'strategic mistake' |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/armenian-pm-says-depending-solely-russia-security-was-strategic-mistake-2023-09-03/ |access-date=2023-09-25}}</ref> The Armenian government's inaction drew anger from many Armenians and resulted in the subsequent protests.

== Protests ==
===19 September===
Hundreds of protesters gathered for a rally outside government buildings in the capital [[Yerevan]] denouncing Pashinyan as being soft on Azerbaijan and weak in Nagorno-Karabakh, including what Pashinyan characterized as calls for a ''[[coup d'Ã©tat]]'' and his removal from office. Pashinyan denounced such calls stating that "We must not allow certain people, certain forces to deal a blow to the Armenian state."<ref>{{cite web |title=Pashinyan slams calls for a 'coup' in Armenia |url=https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/508659.aspx |access-date=19 September 2023 |website=[[Al-Ahram]] |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}</ref> The protesters were met by a police cordon, and clashed with the police in an attempt to storm the [[Government House, Yerevan|Government House]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mehman |first1=Asif |date=19 September 2023 |title=Protesters attempt to storm government building in Armenia's Yerevan |url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3799558.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920071635/https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3799558.html |archive-date=20 September 2023 |access-date=19 September 2023 |publisher=Trend News Agency}}</ref> The protesters and police exchanged glass bottles and stun grenades and several of the building's windows were smashed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Police, Protesters Clash Outside Govt Buildings In Yerevan: TV |url=https://www.barrons.com/news/police-protesters-clash-outside-govt-buildings-in-yerevan-tv-1d453be6?refsec=topics_afp-news |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920071738/https://www.barrons.com/news/police-protesters-clash-outside-govt-buildings-in-yerevan-tv-1d453be6?refsec=topics_afp-news |archive-date=20 September 2023 |access-date=19 September 2023 |website=[[Barron's]] |publisher=[[Agence France Presse]]}}</ref>
