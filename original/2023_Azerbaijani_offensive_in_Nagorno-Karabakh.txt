Two weeks before the clashes, the [[Raphael Lemkin|Lemkin]] Institute for [[Genocide Prevention]] issued a report stating that there was "alarming evidence that President [Ilham] Aliyev may be planning a military assault on Artsakh in the very near future." The report noted that Aliyev had recently signed a new decree ordering all eligible citizens 18 years of age or older to report for military service between 1 and 31 October 2023. The Lemkin Institute also warned that a "military assault on Artsakh could lead to the mass murder stage of [[genocide]]. It would almost assuredly result in the forced displacement of [[Armenians]] from Artsakh and the widespread commission of genocidal atrocities...[and]...Artsakh's Armenians would lose their distinct identity as Artsakhsis, an identity that [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh|has been forged through centuries]]—millennia—of independent cultural flourishing in their mountains and valleys."<ref>{{cite web|date=5 September 2023|title=Applying the UN Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes to the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict|url=https://www.lemkininstitute.com/_files/ugd/9bc553_2e3babd9d7834d7fbcfa262f88c9fa74.pdf|access-date=19 September 2023|work=Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention|archive-date=20 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920071126/https://www.lemkininstitute.com/_files/ugd/9bc553_2e3babd9d7834d7fbcfa262f88c9fa74.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Azerbaijani prison plans ===
In August 2023, Armenian diplomat [[Ara Papian]] reported that Azerbaijan was building a [[concentration camp]] intended for 30,000 Armenian males. The newspaper ''Hraparak'' reported the same information a month later, citing an anonymous military source. In January 2024, ''New Lines'' investigated these reports using [[Planet Labs]] satellite imagery and discovered a large and unfinished complex in a remote area of the [[Aghdam District]] that had been recently built. Satellite records showed construction of the site had begun in July 2022 and ended in late August or early September 2023. Applying [[spatial analysis]] methods, several similarities between the site and known prison structures were identified, and ''New Lines'' concluded the facility was likely intended to be prison. ''New Lines'' also suggested the location of the site was chosen for its close proximity to [[Tigranakert of Artsakh]], ruins of a 2,000-year-old Armenian city, as a form of psychological trauma.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/investigation-armenian-fears-of-a-concentration-camp-in-nagorno-karabakh-may-have-been-warranted/ |title=Investigation: Armenian Fears of a 'Concentration Camp' in Nagorno-Karabakh May Have Been Warranted |date=11 January 2024 |website=New Lines |access-date=12 January 2024 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240112073750/https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/investigation-armenian-fears-of-a-concentration-camp-in-nagorno-karabakh-may-have-been-warranted/ |archive-date=12 January 2024}}</ref>

The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights [[Dunja Mijatović]] visited Armenia and Azerbaijan, including the Karabakh region, from 16 to 23 October 2023, and published on 12 January 2024 her observations. Testimonies provided to the Commissioner by Karabakh Armenians reveal a deep-rooted fear for their lives and future amid armed conflicts, exacerbated by Azerbaijan's control resulting from unresolved past atrocities and ongoing intimidation. Feeling abandoned by all parties and with no security guarantees, the heightened vulnerability experienced during the blockade, and the unexpected reopening of the Lachin corridor in late September 2023, prompted Karabakh Armenians to believe that leaving the region immediately was the only option available to ensure their survival and future well-being. The Commissioner also stated that all displaced persons have the right to return to their homes, regardless of whether they have been displaced internally or across borders, and that both Armenia and Azerbaijan have the obligation to ensure that any return is voluntary, safe and dignified.<ref>{{cite web |title=Armenia and Azerbaijan: effective human rights protection of all persons affected by the conflict over the Karabakh region is key to the success of the peace process |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/armenia-and-azerbaijan-effective-human-rights-protection-of-all-persons-affected-by-the-conflict-over-the-karabakh-region-is-key-to-the-success-of-the-peace-process |website=Commissioner for Human Rights |publisher=Council of Europe |access-date=15 January 2024 |date=12 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Observations on the Human Rights Situation of People affected by the Conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Karabakh region |url=https://rm.coe.int/observations-on-the-human-rights-situation-of-people-affected-by-the-c/1680ae228c}}</ref>

== Analysis ==
Various political analysts and Artsakh residents consider Azerbaijan's underlying goal for the offensive to be [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref name=":0222" /><ref name="OCM" />

[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], the first [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court]], warned that another [[Armenian genocide]] was about to take place. Citing the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]], he stated that Azerbaijan was purposely inflicting living conditions to physically destroy a specific group by blocking the Lachin corridor, and was proceeding to kill and cause "serious bodily and mental harm". Moreno Ocampo stated the inaction of the international community would encourage Azerbaijan in the belief that it would face no serious consequences for committing [[genocide]]. He also discredited Aliyev's claims that his regime was not seeking ethnic cleansing, pointing out that Aliyev regularly referred to Armenia as "[[Western Azerbaijan (political concept)|Western Azerbaijan]]" and claimed "present-day Armenia is our land".<ref name="washingtonpost-genocide" />

[[Thomas de Waal]] said that Azerbaijan was emboldened to start its offensive during a downturn in [[Armenia–Russia relations|relations between Russia and Armenia]], and the loss of the Russian peacekeeping force's "best commanders" to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]]. He also said that Russia could use such a crisis to instigate regime change in Armenia.<ref name="apkarabakh22" />

A group of 123 Turkish academics released a statement warning the international community about Azerbaijan's intentions to commit genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh. In response, the Federation of Eurasian Turkic Associations called for the academics to have their citizenship revoked and for them to be expelled to Armenia.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 September 2023 |title=Turkish nationalists demand citizenship stripping of 123 scholars over Nagorno-Karabakh warning |work=Gercek News |url=https://www.gerceknews.com/turkey/turkish-nationalists-demand-citizenship-stripping-of-123-scholars-over-nagorno-221779h |url-status=live |access-date=28 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929035749/https://www.gerceknews.com/turkey/organizer-announces-re-removal-of-film-from-festival-says-he-is-receiving-death-221861h?history=1&order=2 |archive-date=29 September 2023}}</ref>

Belarusian Nobel Prize laureate [[Ales Bialiatski]] coined the term "Azerbaijanization" to describe [[NATO]] member countries' tendency to ignore violations of human rights when it suits their interests.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karabakh, abandoned Why global diplomacy failed to prevent Azerbaijan's strike on the disputed region, populated mostly by Armenians |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/09/21/karabakh-abandoned |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929141916/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/09/21/karabakh-abandoned |archive-date=29 September 2023 |access-date=29 September 2023}}</ref>

[[Sergey Radchenko]], a historian on [[Cold War]] politics and professor at [[Cardiff University]], questioned the lack of international intervention in Nagorno-Karabakh, comparing the situation to that of [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999]].<ref>{{cite tweet |number=1707978742750982490 |user=DrRadchenko |title=Still trying to wrap my head around the whole business of Nagorno-Karabakh.

What are we looking at here?}}</ref>

Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher at the [[University of Bremen]], attributed the speed of Azerbaijan's victory to its demographic superiority over both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the failure of the latter to strengthen their defenses and strategies against the modernized Azerbaijani military. He also attributed the collapse of the Nagorno-Karabakh military to the weakness and corruption of both the Nagorno-Karabakh and [[Economy of Armenia|Armenian economies]] which turned away potential investors in their militaries and noted that these factors had already contributed to the previous Azerbaijani victory in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |date=28 September 2023 |title=Is the Armenia-Azerbaijan fight for Nagorno-Karabakh finally over? |work=Al Jazeera |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/is-the-armenia-azerbaijan-fight-for-nagorno-karabakh-finally-over |url-status=live |access-date=29 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928154216/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/is-the-armenia-azerbaijan-fight-for-nagorno-karabakh-finally-over |archive-date=28 September 2023}}</ref>
