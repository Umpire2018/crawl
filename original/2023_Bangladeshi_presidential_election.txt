{{Politics of Bangladesh}}
The '''2023 Bangladeshi presidential election''' was scheduled for Sunday, 19 February 2023 to elect the 22nd [[president of Bangladesh]]. However, nominations closed at noon on 12 February and the Awami League politician [[Mohammed Shahabuddin|Mohammed Shahabuddin Chuppu]], who had been nominated in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, was the only candidate nominated. On 13 February 2023, Shahabuddin was thus officially elected as the country's 22nd president as he was unopposed.<ref>{{cite web |title=সংবাদ বিজ্ঞপ্তি |url=http://www.ecs.gov.bd/files/1010TiaK4Nk5oYCjP9V4zOfr94rAeE0giSQHRhXq.pdf |website=www.ecs.gov.bd |publisher=[[Bangladesh Election Commission]] |access-date=13 February 2023 |language=bn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Mohammad Shahabuddin elected 22nd president of Bangladesh |url=https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/v7du0ml03h |access-date=2023-02-13 |work=Prothom Alo |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/shahabuddin-declared-bangladeshs-next-president-3246491 |title=Shahabuddin declared president-elect of Bangladesh |work=The Daily Star |date=13 February 2023 |access-date=13 February 2023}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news |url=https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/df13i4f81g |title=Mohammad Shahbuddin to be elected president uncontested |work=Prothom Alo |date=12 February 2023 |access-date=13 February 2023}}</ref>

== Background ==
As the [[ruling party]] [[Bangladesh Awami League]] has the majority of seats in the [[Jatiya Sangsad]], and the constitution restricts cross-voting, the candidate nominated by the party is supposed to win the election. Besides, opposition parties had already declared that they won't nominate any candidate. Thus AL-nominated candidate Mohammed Shahabuddin won the election unopposed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/pm-greets-al-presidential-candidate-shahabuddin-3245736 |title=PM greets AL presidential candidate Shahabuddin |work=The Daily Star |date=12 February 2023 |access-date=13 February 2023}}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
The president is elected by an [[indirect election]] by the members of [[Jatiya Sangsad|parliament]] as per Article 48 of the Constitution.<ref name="a">{{Cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-367/section-24597.html |title=Article 48 of Bangladesh Constitution - bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd |website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd |language=en |access-date=2018-04-27}}</ref> However, since 1991, when parliamentary government system was restored in Bangladesh, all of government party candidates have been elected uncontestedly.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/abdul-hamid-elected-president-uncontested |title=Abdul Hamid elected President uncontested |work=bdnews24.com |date=13 February 2023 |access-date=13 February 2023}}</ref>

== Election schedule ==
The election schedule was announced by the [[Chief Election Commissioner of Bangladesh|Chief Election Commissioner]] [[Kazi Habibul Awal]] on 25 January 2023, after meeting with the [[Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad|Speaker of the]] [[Jatiya Sangsad]] [[Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury]] the day before.{{Citation needed|date=April 2025}}

== Electoral college ==

On 6 December 2022, seven Members of Parliament (MP) affiliated with the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)]] resigned as part of their anti-government protests. Before the declaration of presidential election schedule, the [[Election Commission of Bangladesh]] published the voter list which listed 343 members, as seven seats were vacant. [[2023 Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad by-elections|On 1 February 2023, by-elections were held]] among the six directly elected seats. Although the Election Commission at first indicated that the by-election winners will not be included in the electoral college, the commission eventually published a revised gazette on 9 February which was composed of 349 members, after the six MPs took their oath on 8 February.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 February 2023 |title=রাষ্ট্রপতি নির্বাচনে ভোটার হলেন নবনির্বাচিত ছয় সংসদ সদস্য |trans-title=Newly-elected six members of parliament become voters in the presidential election |url=https://rtvonline.com/national/211485 |access-date=3 April 2025 |work=[[RTV (Bangladeshi TV channel)|RTV]] |language=bn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=11 February 2023 |title=রাষ্ট্রপতি নির্বাচনের ভোটার হলেন নবনির্বাচিত ছয় এমপি |trans-title=Newly-elected six MPs become voters of the presidential election |url=https://www.jugantor.com/national/643830 |access-date=3 April 2025 |work=[[Jugantor]] |language=bn}}</ref>

=== Responses ===
==== National ====
===== Political parties =====
[[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|Bangladesh Nationalist Party-BNP]] had already expressed their disinterest in the election, as they were already protesting for the resignation of the [[Fourth Hasina ministry|Hasina-led government]].

Before the election, parliamentary main opposition party [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party-JaPa (Ershad)]] had said that they won't nominate any candidate for the election.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 February 2023 |title=রাষ্ট্রপতি নির্বাচনের মনোনয়ন ফরম জমার শেষ দিন রোববার |trans-title=Sunday is the last day to submit nomination form for the presidential election |url=https://www.dhakapost.com/national/173152 |access-date=14 February 2023 |work=[[Dhaka Post]] |language=bn}}</ref>

As Mohammed Shahabuddin was nominated for the election, JaPa's chairman [[Ghulam Muhammed Quader]] welcomed him and hoped that "he would discharge the duty with sincerity for betterment of the country and the nation".<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP has no interest, JaPa welcomes next president Shahabuddin |url=https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/x7uhuocyxl |work=Prothom Alo |date=12 February 2023 |language=en}}</ref> About the responses by others, he said, "The parties which are raising questions about the election, have they not seen the constitution?

They can constitutionally elect the President".{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}
