Parliamentary elections were held in [[Benin]] on 8 January 2023 to elect all 109 members of the [[National Assembly (Benin)|National Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Linkpon |first=Stanislas |date=9 November 2022 |title=Législatives 2023 : plus de 6,6 millions électeurs inscrits sur la liste électorale |url=https://ortb.bj/a-la-une/legislatives-2023-plus-de-66-millions-electeurs-inscrits-sur-la-liste-electorale/ |access-date=8 December 2022 |website=ORTB |language=fr-FR |archive-date=5 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205020359/https://ortb.bj/a-la-une/legislatives-2023-plus-de-66-millions-electeurs-inscrits-sur-la-liste-electorale/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The preliminary results of the election were announced on 11 January.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web | last=Adjoha | first=Pulcherie | title=Benin holds parliamentary election set to test democracy | work=Reuters | date=8 January 2023 | url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-holds-parliamentary-election-set-test-democracy-2023-01-08/ | access-date=8 January 2023 | archive-date=8 January 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230108011738/https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-holds-parliamentary-election-set-test-democracy-2023-01-08/ | url-status=live }}</ref> The result was a victory for parties supportive of President [[Patrice Talon]], the [[Progressive Union (Benin)|Progressive Union]] and [[Republican Bloc]], which together won 81 of the 109 seats.

== Background ==
The [[2016 Beninese presidential election|2016 presidential election]] was won by [[Patrice Talon]], with the country then widely seen as an example of democracy on the African continent.<ref name="participation">{{cite news|title=Bénin : une abstention massive aux législatives pour protester contre le gouvernement|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2019/04/28/benin-a-massive-abstention-at-the-legislative-elections-to-protest-against-the-government_5456027_3212.html|work=Le Monde|date=28 April 2019|language=fr|access-date=14 January 2023}}</ref> However, the [[2019 Beninese parliamentary election|2019 parliamentary elections]] led to a major crisis. Only two parties, both of which supported Talon, were allowed to compete (the [[Progressive Union for Renewal|Progressive Union]] and the [[Republican Bloc]]), with opposition lists failing validation after the implementation of a more restrictive electoral code by the government. The opposition, civil society and NGOs such as Amnesty International denounced what they considered to be an authoritarian drift by the government, damaging the country's democratic reputation.<ref name=participation/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bénin: sale temps pour Cotonou|url=https://www.lepoint.fr/afrique/benin-sale-temps-pour-cotonou-29-04-2019-2309896_3826.php|work=Le Point|language=fr|date=29 April 2019|access-date=14 January 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|language=FR|title=Législatives au Bénin : l'opposition lance un ultimatum à Patrice Talon au lendemain du scrutin|url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/768960/politique/legislatives-au-benin-lopposition-lance-un-ultimatum-a-patrice-talon-au-lendemain-du-scrutin/|website=Jeune Afrique|date=30 April 2019|access-date=14 January 2023}}</ref> The conduct of the parliamentary elections was criticised, including the government cutting off access to the internet and social networks during the vote, and the arrest of opponents and journalists in the months leading up to election day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Benin: in the absence of the opposition, massive abstention in the legislative elections|url=https://www.france24.com/fr/20190429-benin-absence-opposition-abstention-massive-legislatives-patrice-talon|publisher=France 24|date=29 April 2019|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Benin.

As expected, the elections saw a low turnout, with only 27% of voters voting.

Political dialogue was held for six months after the elections and led to an agreement on the rules of participation in the next legislative elections, which was enshrined in a revision of the constitution. Parties could no longer participate in alliances, and were required to present candidates in each constituency to concentrate votes on parties of real national importance. However, during the [[2020 Beninese municipal elections|municipal elections of May 2020]], which involved 546 districts, five parties had their participation validated by the Constitutional Court (CENA), compared to 34 party or party alliance lists in the previous municipal elections in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=[Editorial] Municipalities in Benin, a democratic test – Jeune Afrique|url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/912820/politics/edito-les-municipales-au-benin-un-test-democratique/|website=Jeune Afrique}}</ref> The agreement also led to the number of parliamentary deputies increasing from 83 to 109, but elected for a shortened term of three years, to hold the next set of legislative and municipal elections together in January 2026, followed by presidential elections in April.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Deutsche Welle|title=In Benin, the 9th legislature will serve a transitional term|url=https://www.dw.com/fr/benin-elections-legislatives-inclusives/a-64266457|access-date= 4 January 2023}}</ref> The latter will also see a vice-president elected at the same time as the president, both elected for a term of five years.<ref name=revision1>{{cite news|title=Limitation of the number of elective mandates in Benin: Which candidates for the 2023 legislative and 2026 presidential elections?|url=http://news.acotonou.com/h/144271.html|website=aCotonou|access-date=20 December 2022}}</ref><ref name=revision2>{{cite news|title=Benin, legislatives: the electoral campaign for the January 2023 polls will begin on 23 December|year=2022|url=https://french.news.cn/20221220/fb126fc429934b62adbbe25281a9c101/c.html|publisher=french.news.cn|access-date=20 December 2022}}</ref>

The 109 members of the [[National Assembly (Benin)|National Assembly]] (increased from the prior election's 83) are elected by [[proportional representation]] in 24 multi-member constituencies, based on the country's [[Departments of Benin|departments]], with seats allocated using the simple quotient and then the [[largest remainder method]],<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2033_B.htm Electoral system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925114008/http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2033_B.htm |date=25 September 2017 }} IPU</ref> and an [[electoral threshold]] of 10%.

Provisional results were announced on 11 January, with the [[Progressive Union for Renewal]] (UPR) winning a plurality of seats (53), followed by the [[Republican Bloc]] (BR) and [[The Democrats (Benin)|the Democrats]] (LD) each winning 28 seats.
