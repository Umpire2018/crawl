According to [[Kyrylo Tymoshenko]], deputy head of the [[Office of the President of Ukraine]], the officials onboard had been traveling to a [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|combat zone]] when the helicopter plunged to the ground at 08:20 [[Eastern European Time|EET]]. Eyewitnesses described foggy conditions at the time of the crash, and some reported seeing the helicopter on fire, spinning with its pylon and tail rotor missing, and circling before it hit the ground. The helicopter came to rest against a local kindergarten, resulting in a fire that charred the side of the building. Search and rescue efforts ended later that day, after nearly nine hours.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news |last1=Kramer |first1=Andrew E. |last2=Specia |first2=Megan |date=19 January 2023 |title=Helicopter Crash Kills Ukrainian Minister in Blow to Wartime Leadership |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/world/europe/ukraine-helicopter-crash.html |access-date=19 January 2023 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=19 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119010724/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/world/europe/ukraine-helicopter-crash.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite news |last1=Hunder |first1=Max |last2=Balmforth |first2=Tom |date=18 January 2023 |title=Ukrainian interior minister killed in helicopter crash, Zelenskiy orders probe |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/aircraft-crashes-into-building-outside-ukrainian-capital-kyiv-2023-01-18/ |access-date=19 January 2023 |archive-date=18 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118183825/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/aircraft-crashes-into-building-outside-ukrainian-capital-kyiv-2023-01-18/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="NYT">{{Cite news |last1=Specia |first1=Megan |last2=Kramer |first2=Andrew |date=19 January 2023 |title=Helicopter Crash in Ukraine Kills at Least 14, Including Cabinet Official |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/18/world/russia-ukraine-news |url-access=subscription |access-date=19 January 2023 |archive-date=19 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119120303/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/18/world/russia-ukraine-news |url-status=live }}</ref>
