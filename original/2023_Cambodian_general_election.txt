Siem Reap Provincial Governor Tea Seiha visited Khem Veasna's farm and asked him to disband the crowd.<ref name=":2" />

==== National officials ====
[[Hun Manith]] along with other officials also had gone down to the farm home where the event was taking place and requested Khem Veasna to disband the gatherings.

The property, which is roughly an hour's drive from [[Siem Reap]], is being evacuated by army trucks and ambulances under orders from Prime Minister Hun Sen. According to Hun Sen, the authorities should make it simple for the people to leave the gathering and return home if they choose to do so. Hun Sen claimed that Khem Veasna, the League for Democracy Party's president who recently converted to religion and dubbed himself a Brahma, or celestial king, was pressuring him to use violence to disperse the rally and arrest him. “However, I advised the authorities not to fall into his trap; not to do anything. I will not use violence against him.” Hun Sen had also added, “Veasna cursed me harshly on Facebook, but I am not going to respond with anger. I'll find a peaceful solution for the sake of all people in the Kingdom, he is free to make any claim he wishes, his political career will be over once his supporters discover that he has been lying,” the Prime Minister added.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-31 |title=PM Hun Sen orders military trucks to ferry people leaving 'doomsday' farm and that they not be harmed - Khmer Times |url=https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501142568/pm-hun-sen-orders-military-trucks-to-ferry-people-leaving-doomsday-farm-and-that-they-not-be-harmed/ |access-date=2023-01-21 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Analysis ===
This election was described by many media outlets as a dictator aiming to extend his iron fist rule by holding another carefully controlled election with no genuine competition as he prepares for his son's prospective power ascension.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chen |first=Heather |date=2023-07-21 |title=One of the world's longest serving leaders is set to win another one-sided election |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/asia/cambodia-2023-election-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=2023-08-03 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

After preliminary results started being announced, reports that the [[FUNCINPEC]] won five seats, after which Nhoeun Raden the spokesperson for FUNCINPEC claimed that his party had secured five seats, but the party is still waiting for confirmation from the NEC. Five seats were won by candidates from Phnom Penh and four additional provinces: Kandal, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Prey Veng. This was seen by many as an upturn and FUNCINPEC was seen as a surprise winner. There were allegations of seat sharing and seat adjustments with the ruling [[Cambodian People's Party|CPP]] that according to some gave Funcinpec the unexpected victory. Which were both dismissed by FUNCINPEC and CPP.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-25 |title=A 'well-deserved' victory for Funcinpec - Khmer Times |url=https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501330112/a-well-deserved-victory-for-funcinpec/ |access-date=2023-08-03 |language=en-US}}</ref>
