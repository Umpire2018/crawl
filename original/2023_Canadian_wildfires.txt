Two fires that were out of control in the High Level Forest Area were active on 15 May.<ref name="Update" />

HWF-036, named the Long Lake Fire, is a rapidly growing fire classified as out of control. It is the largest fire in the province during the 2023 wildfire season, currently having an active burning area of {{convert|108402|ha|acre|0}}.<ref name="Update" /> It was started just south of the [[Rainbow Lake Airport]] and initially grew to the northwest. However, due to multiple wind shifts over the following week, the fire began to spread in an eastward direction. On May 13, the fire made a 25-kilometre run towards the community of [[Chateh]]. This also resulted in Rainbow Lake being surrounded in all directions by the wildfire, as well as power and cell service being cut off. Alberta Wildfire, the Rainbow Lake Fire Department and other fire crews from [[Alaska]] and [[Ontario]] are working together to prevent the growth of the fire.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-12 |title=High Level Area Update |url=https://srd.web.alberta.ca/high-level-area-update |access-date=2023-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230512225909/https://srd.web.alberta.ca/high-level-area-update |archive-date=2023-05-12 }}</ref> They deployed 83 firefighters, four helicopters and other heavy equipment by May 15.<ref name="high level">{{cite web |title=High Level Area Update |url=https://srd.web.alberta.ca/high-level-area-update |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230515045836/https://srd.web.alberta.ca/high-level-area-update |archive-date=May 15, 2023 |access-date=May 14, 2023 |website=Alberta Wildfire |publisher=Government of Alberta}}</ref>

HWF-030, named the Paskwa Fire, was another out-of-control fire that spread eastward due to extreme conditions. It reached an active burning area of {{convert|35285|ha|acre|0}}. It was within the community of [[Fox Lake, Alberta|Fox Lake]], and was 13 kilometres from the community of [[Garden River, Alberta|Garden River]]. The fire remained south of the Peace River. The extreme weather conditions made it hard for firefighters and aircraft to assist the fire. 76 firefighters and 13 helicopters were deployed as well as heavy equipment. A state of local emergency was declared for Fox Lake, followed by an evacuation order on May 3. An evacuation alert for Garden River was issued on May 13.<ref name="high level" /> Over 100 structures were destroyed in Fox Lake as of May 11.

HWF-042 was under control at {{convert|181|ha|acre|0}} on May 6. It was {{convert|1|km|mi|0}} north of the [[Alberta Highway 88|Highway 88]] bridge over the [[Peace River]].

Scientists from the [[World Resources Institute]] and the [[University of Maryland]] estimated the overall emissions as 3.28bn tons (2.98 metric tons) more than fossil fuel emissions of [[Greenhouse gas emissions by India|India]]. According to professor Jacob Bendix, “The loss of that much forest is a very big deal, and very worrisome,” “Although the forest will eventually grow back and sequester carbon in doing so, that is a process that will take decades at a minimum, so that there is a quite substantial lag between addition of atmospheric carbon due to wildfire and the eventual removal of at least some of it by the regrowing forest. So, over the course of those decades, the net impact of the fires is a contribution to climate warming.”<ref>{{cite news |title=Canada’s 2023 wildfires created four times more emissions than planes did last year – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/canada-2023-wildfires-carbon-emissions |access-date=7 July 2024 |agency=The Guardian |publisher=The Associated Press |date=27 June 2024}}</ref> The fires represented over a quarter of global tree loss in 2023,<ref name="r744">{{cite journal | last=MacCarthy | first=James | last2=Tyukavina | first2=Alexandra | last3=Weisse | first3=Mikaela J | last4=Harris | first4=Nancy | last5=Glen | first5=Erin | title=Extreme wildfires in Canada and their contribution to global loss in tree cover and carbon emissions in 2023 | journal=Global Change Biology | volume=30 | issue=6 | date=2024 | issn=1354-1013 | doi=10.1111/gcb.17392 | page=}}</ref> and the [[Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service]] estimated that they produced 23% of global wildfire carbon emissions in 2023.<ref name="p380">{{cite web | title= Canada produced 23% of the global wildfire carbon emissions for 2023 | website=Copernicus | date=2023-12-12 | url=https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/copernicus-canada-produced-23-global-wildfire-carbon-emissions-2023 | access-date=2024-08-02}}</ref>

The fires had severe impacts throughout the United States. Air quality dropped to hazardous levels, leading to school closures and cancellations of public events. Reduced visibility led to flight delays and cancellations and reductions in speed limits on roads. Multiple cities were temporarily recorded as having the worst air quality in the world. During May and June, much of the [[Upper Midwest]] experienced the highest [[ozone]] levels ever recorded at a regional scale.<ref name="t381">{{cite journal | last=Cooper | first=Owen R. | last2=Chang | first2=Kai‐Lan | last3=Bates | first3=Kelvin | last4=Brown | first4=Steven S. | last5=Chace | first5=Wyndom S. | last6=Coggon | first6=Matthew M. | last7=Gorchov Negron | first7=Alan M. | last8=Middlebrook | first8=Ann M. | last9=Peischl | first9=Jeff | last10=Piasecki | first10=Alison | last11=Schafer | first11=Nell | last12=Stockwell | first12=Chelsea E. | last13=Wang | first13=Siyuan | last14=Warneke | first14=Carsten | last15=Zuraski | first15=Kristen | last16=Miyazaki | first16=Kazuyuki | last17=Payne | first17=Vivienne H. | last18=Pennington | first18=Elyse A. | last19=Worden | first19=John R. | last20=Bowman | first20=Kevin W. | last21=McDonald | first21=Brian C. | title=Early Season 2023 Wildfires Generated Record‐Breaking Surface Ozone Anomalies Across the U.S. Upper Midwest | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=51 | issue=22 | date=2024 | issn=0094-8276 | doi=10.1029/2024GL111481 | display-authors=2| doi-access=free }}</ref> In Maryland, there was a spike in [[cardiopulmonary]] medical events during the days with the worst air pollution (June 6–8 and 28-30).<ref name="f226">{{cite journal | last=Maldarelli | first=Mary E. | last2=Song | first2=Hyeonjin | last3=Brown | first3=Clayton H. | last4=Situt | first4=Madhurika | last5=Reilly | first5=Colleen | last6=Mahurkar | first6=Anup A. | last7=Felix | first7=Victor | last8=Crabtree | first8=Jonathan | last9=Ellicott | first9=Evan | last10=Jurczak | first10=Martha O. | last11=Pant | first11=Binod | last12=Gumel | first12=Abba | last13=Zafari | first13=Zafar | last14=D’Souza | first14=Warren | last15=Sapkota | first15=Amir | last16=Maron | first16=Bradley A. | title=Polluted Air from Canadian Wildfires and Cardiopulmonary Disease in the Eastern US | journal=JAMA Network Open | publisher=American Medical Association | volume=7 | issue=12 | date=2024-12-13 | issn=2574-3805 | doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.50759 | doi-access=free | page=e2450759 | display-authors=3| pmc=11645649 }}</ref>

=== Facebook blocking wildfire news stories ===
In response to the ''[[Online News Act]]'', [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] (owner of [[Facebook]]) began blocking access to news sites for Canadian users at the beginning of August 2023.<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 1, 2023 |title=Meta starts blocking news in Canada over law on paying publishers |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-starts-process-end-news-availability-canada-2023-08-01/ |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230822081048/https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-starts-process-end-news-availability-canada-2023-08-01/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Lindeman |first=Tracey |date=August 4, 2023 |title='Disaster': warning for democracy as experts condemn Meta over Canada news ban |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/canada-meta-news-ban-facebook-fake |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230826162605/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/canada-meta-news-ban-facebook-fake |url-status=live }}</ref> This also extended to local Canadian news stories about the wildfires,<ref name=":29">{{Cite news |last=Ljunggren |first=David |date=August 18, 2023 |title=Canada demands Meta lift news ban to allow wildfire info sharing |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/canada-demands-meta-lift-ban-news-allow-fires-info-be-shared-2023-08-18/ |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824212724/https://www.reuters.com/technology/canada-demands-meta-lift-ban-news-allow-fires-info-be-shared-2023-08-18/ |url-status=live }}</ref> a decision that was heavily criticized by Trudeau, local government officials, academics, researchers, and evacuees.<ref name=":30">{{Cite news |last1=Woolf |first1=Marie |last2=Walsh |first2=Marieke |last3=Smith |first3=Alanna |others=With a report from [[The Canadian Press]] |date=August 21, 2023 |title=Trudeau accuses Facebook of prioritizing profits by blocking news access during wildfires |language=en-CA |work=The Globe and Mail |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-facebook-trudeau-wildfires-bill-c18/ |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824145856/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-facebook-trudeau-wildfires-bill-c18/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gillies |first=Rob |date=August 21, 2023 |title=Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slams Facebook for blocking Canada wildfire news |work=Associated Press |url=https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-facebook-news-blocking-734a5bc05796e38a011c6c9a473efea8 |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230825141252/https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-facebook-news-blocking-734a5bc05796e38a011c6c9a473efea8 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":31">{{Cite news |last=Evans |first=Pete |date=August 18, 2023 |title=N.W.T. wildfire evacuees say Facebook's news ban 'dangerous' in emergency situation |work=CBC News |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nwt-wildfire-evacuation-meta-blocking-news-1.6939286 |access-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-date=August 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824212009/https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nwt-wildfire-evacuation-meta-blocking-news-1.6939286 |url-status=live }}</ref> Trudeau accused Facebook of "putting corporate profits ahead of people’s safety," with [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[David Eby]] expressing similar sentiments.<ref name=":30" />
