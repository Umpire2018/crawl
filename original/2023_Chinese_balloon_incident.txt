High-altitude balloons are extremely difficult to detect. A 2005 study by the U.S. Air Force's [[Air University (United States Air Force)|Air University]] states surveillance balloons often present very small [[radar cross-section]]s, "on the order of hundredths of a square meter, about the same as a small bird", and essentially no [[infrared signature]], which complicates the use of [[anti-aircraft weapons]].<ref name="thedrive/more-complicated"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Tomme |first=Lt.

== Legality of airspace and downing ==
The United States asserts sovereignty of the airspace above its territories. Like that of other countries, this right, up to the ill-defined boundary of space, is recognized by the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation]]. Foreign aircraft are generally permitted to transit through U.S. airspace but must follow specific procedures and regulations. Article 8 of the convention states that aircraft flown without pilots must obtain permission from the country below and must be controlled to reduce danger.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Elias |first=Bart |date=2023-02-27 |title=Monitoring the Sovereign Skies |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12118 |journal=Insight |publisher=Congressional Research Service |access-date=2023-03-02}}</ref>

[[John Blaxland (historian)|John Blaxland]], a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the [[Australian National University]], suggested that China likely expected the balloon to be detected and being detected was the goal.

== Additional assessments of the balloon ==
Following the April [[2023 Pentagon document leaks]], ''The Washington Post'' uncovered additional information from a trove of classified files on [[Discord]] that had previously not been reported.<ref name=":82"/> They include U.S. assessment of the Chinese balloon's power generation capability (up to 10,000 watts), which would be sufficient to operate [[synthetic-aperture radar]] equipment if carried on board, and how parts of the Chinese government were surprised by the balloon's North American incursion, judging from intercepted communications. U.S. intelligence had been aware of four other similar balloons, one of which had flown over a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'']] [[Carrier battle group|carrier strike group]] in western Pacific, while another had crashed in the [[South China Sea]]. The documents did not date those incidents. The Pentagon and the [[Office of National Intelligence]] declined to comment.<ref name=":82" />

In June, preliminary investigation by the U.S. reported the presence of reconnaissance equipment on board the balloon downed in February. There were conflicting reports on whether it had collected any intelligence during its flight.<ref>{{Cite news |last= |date=2023-06-29 |title=Chinese spy balloon did not collect information over US, Pentagon says |language=en |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/chinese-spy-balloon-did-not-collect-information-over-us-pentagon-2023-06-29/ |access-date=2023-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Bertrand |first=Natasha |date=2023-04-03 |title=Chinese spy balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref> It does not appear to have sent anything back to China. ''The Wall Street Journal'' said the balloon [[export control|carried off-the-shelf]] U.S. gear.<ref name=":92"/> Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General [[Patrick S. Ryder]] did not confirm that information but said that Chinese drones in the past have utilized off-the-shelf U.S. equipment.<ref name=":92" /> He also said that mitigation efforts "contributed" to the balloon not collecting any intelligence while transiting or overflying the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-06-29 |title=US says Chinese spy balloon downed in February did not collect information |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/chinese-spy-balloon-shot-information-biden |access-date=2023-06-30 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

On September 17, 2023, in an interview with CBS news, General Mark Milley, the retiring 20th US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated “I would say it was a spy balloon that we know with high degree of certainty got no intelligence, and didn't transmit any intelligence back to China." Technical experts had also found that the balloon's sensors had never been activated while it was travelling over the Continental United States. The general also touched on a leading theory that the reason that it was flying over the United States, was probably because it was blown off-track, where the balloon had been heading towards Hawaii however winds at 60,000 feet simply came into the equation. Milley said, "those winds are very high.. the particular motor on that aircraft can't go against those winds at that altitude."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-09-17 |title=The bizarre secret behind China's spy balloon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bizarre-secret-behind-chinas-spy-132621162.html |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Yahoo News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=China's spy balloon: What we've learned - CBS San Francisco |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/video/chinas-spy-balloon-what-weve-learned/ |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to US intelligence officials as reported by NBC News on December 28, 2023, the balloon utilized a commercially available internet service provider based in the US primarily for navigation guidance.
