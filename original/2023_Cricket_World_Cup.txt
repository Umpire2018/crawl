The '''2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup''' was the 13th edition of the [[ICC Men's Cricket World Cup]], a quadrennial [[One Day International]] (ODI) [[cricket]] tournament organized by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). It was hosted from 5 October to 19 November 2023 across ten venues in [[India]]. This was the fourth World Cup held in India, but the first where India was the sole host.

The tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the same format used in [[2019 Cricket World Cup|2019]]. After six weeks of round-robin matches, [[India national cricket team|India]], [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four and qualified for the knockout stage. In the knockout stage, India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa, respectively, to advance to the final, played on 19 November at the [[Narendra Modi Stadium]] in [[Ahmedabad]]. Australia won the final by six wickets, winning their sixth Cricket World Cup title.

A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended the matches, the highest number in any Cricket World Cup to date.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 ODI World Cup shatters viewership records |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/2023-odi-world-cup-shatters-viewership-records-1410361 |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=ESPNcricinfo |language=en}}</ref> The tournament final set viewership records in India, drawing 518 million viewers, with a peak of 57 million streaming viewers.

== Background ==
=== Host selection ===
On 11 December 2017, India was announced by the ICC as hosts of the 2023 Cricket World Cup; while India had served as a co-host during three previous tournaments (most recently in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]], which it co-hosted with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), it would mark the first Cricket World Cup to be hosted solely by India.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-12-11 |title=India to host 2023 World Cup, Champions Trophy in 2021 |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-to-host-2023-world-cup-champions-trophy-in-2021/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=The Indian Express |language=en}}</ref>

The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai]] and [[Eden Gardens]] in [[Kolkata]] respectively, while the final took place at [[Narendra Modi Stadium]] in [[Ahmedabad]].<ref name="Fixtures" />

The BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. [[Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium]] received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. [[M. A. Chidambaram Stadium]] installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 June 2023 |title=Cricket World Cup venues to get an upgrade: Imported grass, new outfields, better floodlights |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cricket-world-cup-venues-to-get-an-upgrade-imported-grass-new-outfields-better-floodlights-8693468/ |access-date=30 June 2023 |website=[[The Indian Express]] |archive-date=11 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230711043931/https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cricket-world-cup-venues-to-get-an-upgrade-imported-grass-new-outfields-better-floodlights-8693468/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moistureâ€”including [[dew]] and rainâ€”on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the [[2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup|2021 Men's T20 World Cup]]). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around {{Convert|70|m|yds|abbr=in}} at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage [[seam bowling]] over [[spin bowling]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 September 2023 |title=ODI World Cup: More grass, bigger boundaries to tackle dew factor |work=The Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/odi-world-cup-more-grass-bigger-boundaries-to-tackle-dew-factor/articleshow/103795737.cms?from=mdr |access-date=5 October 2023 |issn=0971-8257 |archive-date=30 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230930191203/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/odi-world-cup-more-grass-bigger-boundaries-to-tackle-dew-factor/articleshow/103795737.cms?from=mdr |url-status=live }}</ref>
