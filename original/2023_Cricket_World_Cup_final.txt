===India innings===
India made a quick start to their innings, with captain [[Rohit Sharma]] hitting 47 from 31 balls despite losing opening partner [[Shubman Gill]] early on. The loss of Rohit via a brilliant Travis Head catch, and [[Shreyas Iyer]] soon after left themselves 81/3.<ref name="BBCR">{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Matthew |date=19 November 2023 |title=Cricket World Cup 2023: Australia stun hosts India to win sixth title as Travis Head hits century |work=[[BBC Sport]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/67467918 |url-status=live |access-date=19 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231119161937/https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/67467918 |archive-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> [[Virat Kohli]] and [[K. L. Rahul]] added 67 for the fourth wicket. Later Kohli was dismissed due to a slower ball from Pat Cummins; which Kohli inside-edged onto his stumps.<ref name="BBCR" /> India continued to add runs slowly -- scoring 2 boundaries in a 28 over period (10-38) -- until Rahul was dismissed for 66 to leave India 203/6, and the remaining batsmen were not able to score quickly. The innings ended when [[Kuldeep Yadav]] was run-out on the last ball of the innings with the score on 240.<ref name="BBCR" />

===Australia innings===
Following a flurry of runs in the opening overs, Australia innings' almost fell apart, with [[Mohammed Shami]] removing Warner and [[Jasprit Bumrah]] getting [[Mitchell Marsh]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]]. At that point, Australia were 47 for 3 after 7 overs.<ref name="BBCR" /> While India was looking for more wickets, [[Travis Head]] and [[Marnus Labuschagne]] then built a partnership, which put on 192 runs in 35.5 overs. Australia were within two runs of victory when Head was dismissed by [[Mohammed Siraj]] for 137.<ref name="BBCR" /> [[Glenn Maxwell]] was the next batsman in, and hit the winning two runs off the next ball, to give Australia a 6-wicket victory.<ref name="BBCR" />

== Aftermath ==

In the aftermath of the match, many supporters of the Indian team took to social media to troll and harass Australian players and their families.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-20 |title=Cricket fans called out for 'disgusting' and 'hateful' attacks after Aussie World Cup win |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/icc-world-cup/cricket-fans-called-out-for-disgusting-and-hateful-attacks-after-aussie-world-cup-win/news-story/3481828c2acbea309f21e3d832d6ec71 |access-date=2023-11-23 |website=Fox Sports |language=en |archive-date=23 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231123065659/https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/icc-world-cup/cricket-fans-called-out-for-disgusting-and-hateful-attacks-after-aussie-world-cup-win/news-story/3481828c2acbea309f21e3d832d6ec71 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some fans even sent death and [[rape threats]] directed at players and their families, resulting in many Australian players filing complaints with [[Cricket Australia]] and the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-21 |title=Australian cricketers file complaint with CA over receiving death and rape threats for them and their families from Indian fans after World Cup final: Report |url=http://crictoday.com/cricket/news/australian-cricketers-file-complaint-with-ca-over-receiving-death-and-rape-threats-for-them-and-their-families-from-indian-fans-after-world-cup-final-report/ |access-date=2023-11-23 |website=Crictoday |language=en-US |archive-date=23 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231123065701/https://crictoday.com/cricket/news/australian-cricketers-file-complaint-with-ca-over-receiving-death-and-rape-threats-for-them-and-their-families-from-indian-fans-after-world-cup-final-report/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Harbhajan Singh]], a former player on the Indian team, condemned the trolls, saying "Reports of trolling of family members of Australian cricket players is completely in bad taste.
