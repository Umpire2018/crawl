The riot was triggered by a man [[Mass stabbing|stabbing]] three young children and a care assistant at around 1:30{{nbsp}}p.m. [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] that day outside a [[primary school]] in [[Parnell Square|Parnell Square East]], Dublin. A five-year-old girl was critically injured and the care assistant—who had tried to shield the children with her own body—was seriously injured.

The five-year-old girl was discharged from hospital in August 2024.

By 5{{nbsp}}p.m., a crowd of 100 to 200 [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] demonstrators had gathered at Parnell Square. The unrest began at around 6{{nbsp}}p.m. when demonstrators began throwing fireworks, flares and bottles at the Gardaí who were maintaining [[Kettling|a cordon]] around the crime scene.

Following the riot, the [[Garda Commissioner]], [[Drew Harris]], blamed the events on a "lunatic, hooligan faction driven by a far-right ideology." Other public figures criticised policing in Dublin city and called for the resignations of Harris and the [[Minister for Justice (Ireland)|Minister for Justice]], [[Helen McEntee]]. The minister subsequently survived a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] in [[Dáil Éireann]]. The government implemented additional riot-prevention measures after the incident, borrowing [[water cannon]]s from the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], passing new laws enabling the use of [[police body camera]]s, and announcing plans to expand the use of hand-held [[video camera]]s, [[taser]]s, and [[pepper spray]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Paul |date=2023-11-29 |title=Public Order Unit to be issued with tasers, says Harris |work=[[RTÉ News]] |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2023/1129/1419129-garda-justice/ |access-date=2023-11-30 |archive-date=29 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129142432/http://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2023/1129/1419129-garda-justice/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
