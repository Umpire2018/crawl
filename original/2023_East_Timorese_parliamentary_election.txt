== Background ==
{{See also|VIII Constitutional Government of Timor-Leste|2022 East Timorese presidential election}}

Initially, after the [[2018 East Timorese parliamentary election]], the VIII Constitutional Government was drawn from and supported by a coalition known as the [[Alliance for Change and Progress]] (AMP), which was made up of the [[National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction]] (CNRT), the [[People's Liberation Party (Timor-Leste)|People's Liberation Party]] (PLP) and [[Kmanek Haburas Unidade Nasional Timor Oan]] (KHUNTO).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leach |first1=Michael |title=A first test for Timor-Leste's cohabitants |url=https://insidestory.org.au/a-first-test-for-timor-lestes-cohabitants/ |work=Inside Story |access-date=30 November 2020 |date=14 August 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20221221234014/https://insidestory.org.au/a-first-test-for-timor-lestes-cohabitants/|archive-date=21 December 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Prime Minister of Timor-Leste|Prime Minister]] [[Mari Bin Amude Alkatiri|Marí Bin Amude Alkatiri]] of Fretilin had to hand over his office to Taur Matan Ruak of the PLP. However, a large number of the candidates nominated by the CNRT for government posts were refused appointment by President Francisco Guterres (FRETILIN), as he considered them unsuitable for various reasons. Taur Matan Ruak managed to form a [[Cabinet of Timor-Leste|cabinet]] anyway by having the vacant positions of the missing CNRT members co-administered by other government members. In the National Parliament, the AMP denied the opposition parties Fretilin and [[Democratic Party (Timor-Leste)|Partido Democrático]] (PD) adequate participation in the presidium and in the management of the committees, which led to further conflicts.

[[File:2020-06-27 Taur Matan Ruak 1.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[Taur Matan Ruak]] addressing the public in 2020]]
In 2020, CNRT MPs increasingly blamed Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak for the fact that most of the CNRT ministers were still not in office after 18 months. On 17 January, the government's budget proposal failed because CNRT MPs abstained. Taur Matan Ruak therefore declared the end of the AMP, but President Guterres asked him to continue leading the government for the time being. On 22 February, CNRT, KHUNTO, PD, [[Timorese Democratic Union]] (UDT), [[Frenti-Mudança]] (FM) and [[United Party for Development and Democracy]] (PUDD) signed a coalition agreement to form a new government. However, Guterres again did not accept Taur Matan Ruak's request to resign two days later and instead asked him to continue leading the transitional government. With the outbreak of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Timor-Leste]] at the end of March, another crisis hit the country. KHUNTO then declared that it would now support Taur Matan Ruak again, and he withdrew his request for resignation on 8 April. The proposal of the Six Party Alliance to appoint Gusmão as Prime Minister was not answered by President Guterres. On 27 April, the coalition lost a vote in parliament on the state of emergency over COVID-19, as PLP, KHUNTO, and Fretilin voted unanimously. This was the end of the coalition, and the VIII government now included Fretilin representatives in the cabinet, as well as [[Júlio Sarmento da Costa]] of the PD, who now also supported the government. Parliamentary Speaker [[Arão Noé da Costa Amaral]] of the CNRT was replaced by [[Aniceto Guterres Lopes]] of Fretilin and the committee boards were reconstituted, now excluding the CNRT.

Following the breakdown of the AMP coalition during the first few months of 2020, a new governing coalition took place in the form of four-party government of [[Fretilin]]–[[People's Liberation Party (Timor-Leste)|PLP]]–[[Kmanek Haburas Unidade Nasional Timor Oan|KHUNTO]]–[[Democratic Party (Timor-Leste)|PD]] on 12 May 2020,<ref name="tatoli 2020-05-14">{{cite news |last1=Soares Martins |first1=Evaristo |date=14 May 2020 |title=PM Taur Matan Ruak Gains Two Deputies in Government Restructure |work=Tatoli |url=http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/14/pm-taur-matan-ruak-gains-two-deputies-in-government-restructure/ |access-date=28 June 2020 |archive-date=2 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702104225/http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/14/pm-taur-matan-ruak-gains-two-deputies-in-government-restructure/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="tatoli 2020-05-25">{{cite news |last1=Sanchez |first1=Hortencio |date=25 May 2020 |title=Foreign Minister Dionísio Soares Among Five MPs to Resign From Cabinet |work=Tatoli |url=http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/25/dionisio-soares-resigns-as-foreign-minister/?fbclid=IwAR0-sF4xO6Uge6FXDXLKZ9btn3Qpe03xhReTxumx1vPCcplykh1_rf_sbLk |access-date=27 May 2020 |archive-date=30 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630030524/http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/25/dionisio-soares-resigns-as-foreign-minister/?fbclid=IwAR0-sF4xO6Uge6FXDXLKZ9btn3Qpe03xhReTxumx1vPCcplykh1_rf_sbLk |url-status=live }}</ref> new officials were appointed on 29 May<ref name="tatoli 2020-05-29">{{cite news |last1=Colo |first1=Cipriano |date=29 May 2020 |title=Eight New Members Sworn into TL Cabinet |work=Tatoli |url=http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/29/eight-new-members-sworn-into-tl-cabinet/ |access-date=28 June 2020 |archive-date=6 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201206114015/http://www.tatoli.tl/en/2020/05/29/eight-new-members-sworn-into-tl-cabinet/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="sapo 2020-05-29">{{cite news |date=29 May 2020 |title=Presidente timorense dá posse a oito novos membros do Governo |language=pt |trans-title=Timorese President swears in eight new members of the Government |website=[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP News]] |agency=[[Lusa News Agency|Lusa]] |url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/presidente-timorense-da-posse-a-oito-novos-membros-do-governo_n1232707 |access-date=27 November 2020 |archive-date=6 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106125114/https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/presidente-timorense-da-posse-a-oito-novos-membros-do-governo_n1232707 |url-status=live }}</ref> and 24 June 2020.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 June 2020 |title=Swearing-In and organic structure of the Eight Constitutional Government |url=http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=24746&lang=en&n=1 |access-date=28 June 2020 |website=Government of Timor-Leste |archive-date=6 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106002845/http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=24746&n=1&lang=en |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 14 March, President Ramos-Horta vetoed a number of amendments to the electoral law. In his letter to MPs in parliament, he supported the planned introduction of [[postal voting]] and documents in [[Braille]], but rejected the parallel polling stations for voters who cannot travel to their home town to vote. These had been introduced for the first time in the last presidential elections and were now to be extended. Ramos-Horta explained that the necessary mechanisms and registers would be lacking to prevent double voting. He also criticised the planned direct forwarding of the counting data to the [[National Electoral Commission (Timor-Leste)|National Electoral Commission]] (CNE), although the constitution requires a listing first at the ballot box and then at the municipal level. Moreover, the new electoral law does not mention the new municipality of Atauro, which is why there is no [[polling station]] on the island at all. Parliament now had to decide on the amendments requested by the head of state.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Lusa |date=14 March 2023 |title=Presidente timorense contesta centros paralelos de votação no veto à lei para eleições |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/132023013521454/permalink/6096085953781767/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Facebook |language=en}}</ref> On 20 March, by 37 votes to 22 (with two abstentions), parliament sent the law back to Ramos-Horta unchanged.<ref>{{Cite web |last=de Deus |first=Isaura Lemos |date=2023-03-20 |title=Parlamento Nacional confirma lei eleitoral e reenvia-a ao Chefe de Estado |url=https://pt.tatoli.tl/2023/03/20/parlamento-nacional-confirma-lei-eleitoral-e-reenvia-a-ao-chefe-de-estado/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=TATOLI Agência Noticiosa de Timor-Leste |language=en-US}}</ref> If the new law is passed again, the president is obliged to sign it into law.<ref name=":3" />

However, the tribunal also found the [[Millennium Democratic Party (Timor-Leste)|Millennium Democratic Party]] (PMD), the [[Democratic Republic of Timor Party]] (PDRT), the [[People's Party of Development]] (PDP) and the [[Timorese Democratic Party]] (PTD) ineligible to contest the 2023 general elections due to a lack of legal requirements.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Lusa |date=15 March 2023 |title=Tribunal de Recurso timorense pede mexidas na lei para não penalizar coligações |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/216102715072019/permalink/7016025685079654/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Facebook |language=en}}</ref>

At the end of January, the [[Democratic Alliance (Timor-Leste)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) was founded by the [[National Democratic Alliance (Timor-Leste)|National Democratic Alliance]] (AND), PDP and [[People's Freedom Party of the Aileba]] (PLPA). The official recognition of the AND as a political party at the Tribunal has not yet been completed.<ref name=":4" />

On 4 March, four parties formed an electoral alliance. The [[Broad Democratic Front]] (FAD) includes the UDT and the FM as well as the two parties not represented in parliament, [[Timorese Social Democratic Action Center]] (CASDT) and [[National Development Party (Timor-Leste)|National Development Party]] (PDN).<ref name=":4" /> Another coalition was announced by the PDRT and the [[Timorese People's Monarchist Association]] (APMT).<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-04 |title=Coligação de forças sem assento parlamentar quer consensos em Timor-Leste |url=https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2231228/coligacao-de-forcas-sem-assento-parlamentar-quer-consensos-em-timor-leste |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Notícias ao Minuto |language=pt}}</ref>

On 13 March, the CNE confirmed the notification of the three coalitions,<ref name=":5" /> but the tribunal rejected all three alliances. The PDP from the Democratic Alliance and the PDRT would both have failed to meet the legal requirements as electable parties, making their party alliances obsolete. The AND had not yet gained recognition as a party anyway. In the case of the FAD, the PDN had withdrawn from the alliance on 14 March and filed an [[election petition]] as an individual party. The tribunal found that in the case of the PDN, no congress or national conference had confirmed cooperation with the other parties, which meant that the entire FAD did not receive registration. The remaining partners of the various alliances still had the option of filing for election individually.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lusa |date=15 March 2023 |title=Partidos de coligações timorenses chumbadas pelo tribunal vão concorrer sozinhos |url=https://www.facebook.com/NoticiasEmPortuguesDeTimor/posts/pfbid0211LQ58kUgHPHLHnfh2cfzsbwBeEzU2gBTRtxsGfmfhJnT18JiCEsQVhyAhG52z5Gl |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Facebook |language=en}}</ref>

By the deadline of 15 March, a total of 18 parties had submitted their electoral lists. Due to the internal party dispute in the [[Frenti-Mudança]], electoral lists were submitted by both party leader [[Ricardo Cardoso Nheu]] and his predecessor [[Egídio de Jesus]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |last=Lusa |date=15 March 2023 |title=Dezassete partidos registam candidaturas no Tribunal de Recurso para legislativas timorenses |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/216102715072019/permalink/7016178555064367/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Facebook |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=da Piedade |first=Domingos |date=2023-03-16 |title=Boletins de voto das legislativas poderão ter 18 opções |url=https://pt.tatoli.tl/2023/03/16/boletins-de-voto-das-legislativas-poderao-ter-18-opcoes/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=TATOLI Agência Noticiosa de Timor-Leste |language=en-US}}</ref> Following the incidents surrounding the admission of electoral alliances and the question of which parties should be allowed to contest at all, both the tribunal and the CNE demanded that the future legislature clarify its jurisdiction over the decision to admit parties and electoral alliances, as this is where the court and the electoral authority come into conflict.<ref name=":6" />

On 25 March, the tribunal ruled that 17 parties could contest the election. The Frenti-Mudança was refused admission to the election. There was no clarification as to which of the two lists represented the party and an attempt at conciliation between the two groups failed. The official list was published in the Jornal da República on 29 March.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite web |title=Tribunal de Recurso timorense valida candidaturas de 17 partidos a legislativas de 21 de maio |url=https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/atualidade/tribunal-de-recurso-timorense-valida_641ec61525390848a63a2bfb |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=SAPO |language=pt}}</ref>

On 15 April, leaders of the ruling parties Fretilin, PLP and KHUNTO signed an agreement to form a joint government alliance after the elections.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 April 2023 |title=Timor-Leste/Eleições: Partidos do Governo assinam compromisso pré-eleitoral |url=https://www.lusa.pt/article/2023-04-15/40622030/timor-leste-elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es-partidos-do-governo-assinam-compromisso-pr%C3%A9-eleitoral |access-date=22 May 2023 |website=Lusa.pt}}</ref>

The PLPA and the AND concluded a "strategic agreement" which, if entered into parliament, would last for the entire legislative period until 2028.

The election campaign officially began on 19 April and ran until 18 May.<ref name=":8" /> José Agostinho da Costa Belo, the president of the CNE, called on the parties to suspend campaigning on 20 April because a [[Solar eclipse|total solar eclipse]] was going to take place in Timor-Leste on that day.

In advance, the Matadalan Research Institute released the results of a survey it conducted among 400 people in all parts of the country between 24 March and 3 April. Voters in the [[diaspora]] were not included in the survey. According to the results, 49% of the respondents supported the CNRT. 25% would vote for FRETILIN, 5.5% for PD and 5.25% for KHUNTO. Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak's PLP would fail the four-percent hurdle with 3.5%. The Greens would get 1% and all other parties together 7.75%. The margin of error in the poll was 5%. When asked who should be prime minister, 60.25% said Xanana Gusmão (CNRT), 19% Marí Alkatiri (FRETILIN) and 6.25% Taur Matan Ruak. 6% wanted [[Mariano Sabino Lopes]] (PD) and 2.75% [[Armanda Berta dos Santos]] (KHUNTO). When asked about possible coalitions, 27.75% wanted an alliance between CNRT and PD and only 17.75% wanted the current coalition of Fretilin, PLP and KHUNTO. 12% wanted a coalition of CNRT, Fretilin and PD and 8.25% wanted one of CNRT, PD and PLP.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web |title=Sondagem aponta CNRT como partido com mais apoio nas eleições em Timor-Leste |url=https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/atualidade/sondagem-aponta-cnrt-como-partido-com-mais_643a6002a68aa948e0039b04 |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=SAPO |language=pt}}</ref>[[File:2023-04-20 KHUNTO.jpg|thumb|Election campaign event of the KHUNTO in [[Ainaro]]]]For almost all major parties, most respondents said they had made their decision based on the party's programme or vision. In the case of KHUNTO, however, 30% of their supporters said they had chosen them because of family ties to their party leadership. When asked who they would like to see as prime minister, Gusmão could attribute his support to his personal background and work, while for the other politicians the reason is the party behind them. The most important issues for respondents were infrastructure development (43%), job creation (22.75%) and education (14%).<ref name=":9" />

In mid-April, [[Abel de Conceição]], the administrator of the [[Aileu Municipality|municipality of Aileu]], had [[National Police of Timor-Leste|police]] officers break up a public debate on "Building a new just and solidary society" at the Uma Dame Peace Centre in [[Aileu]]. The event, where representatives of different political forces were to discuss, had been organised by the Youth Movement of the Municipality of Aileu (MJMA). Conceição justified the dissolution with the given period of the election campaign and that debates between the parties could only be organised by the electoral bodies. President Ramos-Horta criticised the action and stressed the constitutional right to organise events and express their views on political issues. When asked by [[Virgílio da Silva Guterres]], the ombudsman of the Provedoria dos Direitos Humanos e Justiça (PDHJ), Conceição expressed regret that he had not wanted to restrict citizens' rights, but only to implement the guidelines of the CNE and STAE. Guterres stressed that this was not the responsibility of the municipal administration, but of the CNE, and [[Miguel Pereira de Carvalho]], Conceição's predecessor as Minister of State Administration, also stated that the municipal administrator had neither the power to decide on the authorisation of such events, nor could he give instructions to the police.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-18 |title=Visão {{!}} PR timorense pede a provedoria que investigue ações de administrador de Aileu |url=https://visao.sapo.pt/atualidade/mundo/2023-04-18-pr-timorense-pede-a-provedoria-que-investigue-acoes-de-administrador-de-aileu/ |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Visão |language=pt-PT}}</ref>[[File:2023-05-16 FRETILIN political campaign.jpg|thumb|Fretilin campaign "crocodile-mobile"]]The CNRT rejected FRETILIN's proposal of two debates during the election campaign between Alkatiri and Gusmão, as the proposed topics were not considered appropriate. The topics were the agreement on the [[Timor Gap|maritime dispute]] and border with Australia that Gusmão had negotiated and the Haksolok ferry construction affair. The CNRT is held partly responsible for the fact that the ferry is not in Timor-Leste after years following the bankruptcy of the Portuguese shipyard. In the vote on the border treaty, Alkatiri had FRETILIN vote against it in parliament, which he is accused of betraying. However, Alkatiri sees mistakes in the treaty and wanted to confront Gusmão with them. Likewise with mistakes in politics, of which Gusmão would pretend that he had never led the government in the last 15 years.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-25 |title=CNRT rejeita debate com Fretilin por não considerar temas apropriados |url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/cnrt-rejeita-debate-com-fretilin-por-nao-considerar-temas-apropriados_n1481879 |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Rádio e Televisão de Portugal |language=pt}}</ref>

On 27 April, riots broke out between supporters of different parties in Daco Ate (Suco [[Afaloicai]]) during the election campaign.

On 15 May, President Ramos-Horta criticised parties that work with {{ill|Gangs in Timor-Leste|de|Bandenwesen in Osttimor|lt=martial arts groups}} in an interview. These parties and their "unscrupulous leaders" would manipulate youth and turn martial arts into a political tool. Ramos-Horta hinted that he might not approve a cabinet that includes such parties. The head of state emphasised that martial arts itself and the connection of some groups to [[Indonesia]] were not the problem. Ramos-Horta explained that he would be concerned if such a party were to head the [[Ministry of the Interior (Timor-Leste)|Ministry of Interior]], for example, in a coalition, with a budget of $100 million; a direct reference to the current government. Deputy Interior Minister [[Antonino Armindo]] belongs to KHUNTO, which is closely linked to the martial arts organisation Korka. In addition to KHUNTO, the Greens also have close links with a martial arts group, the 7-7. At both parties, members of the martial arts groups and their leaders appear and display symbols and hand gestures of the groups. The non-governmental organisation ''[[Fundasaun Mahein]]'' has already warned of an increasing politicisation of the martial arts groups in the country. It also said these groups were infiltrating various state institutions, which "could contribute to more violence and socio-political instability". Ramos-Horta called on the population not to vote for such parties.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-15 |title=PR critica partidos que manipulam jovens das artes marciais para se infiltrar no Estado |url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/pr-critica-partidos-que-manipulam-jovens-das-artes-marciais-para-se-infiltrar-no-estado_n1486435 |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=RTP |language=pt}}</ref>

Voter turnout fell slightly to 79.3% from 80.98% in 2018, though the number of registered voters and overall total votes cast rose from 2018 due to the country's growing population.<ref name=":12" /> President Ramos-Horta said he would invite the strongest party (the CNRT) to talks on forming a government.

The platform of the old ruling parties, Fretilin, KHUNTO and PLP, will probably only get 28 of the 65 seats, less than the CNRT alone, thus failed to unite the majority of seats. The Greens narrowly failed to clear the four-percent hurdle, followed by the PUDD. All other parties got less than one per cent of the vote each. The Fretilin was only the strongest party in its strongholds of [[Lautém Municipality|Lautém]], [[Viqueque Municipality|Viqueque]] and [[Baucau Municipality|Baucau]]. Otherwise, the CNRT was always ahead, even in polling stations abroad. In the municipality of [[Ermera Municipality|Ermera]], the CNRT even received an absolute majority of 51.05% of the votes.

The final result is to be presented by the STAE by 27 May. The Supreme Court will then officially announce the result and the [[Jornal da República]] will publish it by 7 June. The new parliament is expected to meet for the first time on 12 June.

The observers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries attested that "under the specific conditions observed, the entire electoral process was reliable and credible, and gave no cause for complaint that could compromise the transparency and integrity of the electoral process".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-23 |title=Observadores da CPLP aprovam eleições em Timor-Leste |url=https://rr.sapo.pt/noticia/mundo/2023/05/23/observadores-da-cplp-aprovam-eleicoes-em-timor-leste/332436/ |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Renascença (SAPO)}}</ref> The [[United States Department of State]] congratulated Timor-Leste for "free, fair and transparent" elections that were "an inspiration to democracy worldwide".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-22 |title=Timor-Leste.

On 23 May, in his first public reaction after the completion of the vote count by the STAE, Xanana Gusmão said that the vote reflects the population’s fatigue and calls for implementing the need for change.<ref name=":13" />  Without wanting to confirm whether he will be prime minister, he did admit that he is waiting for the official certification of the results before moving forward with party alliances and forming the next government. He stated that the next government will be one of "consolidation of the State and the institutions". Gusmão also thanked the population for their maturity and peaceful behavior during the voting process.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":15" />

Within Fretilin, voices were raised calling for the resignation of the party leadership after this "humiliating" defeat. [[José Agostinho Sequeira]] declared that Alkatiri and Guterres were no longer alternatives. Sequeira had failed as a candidate for the party presidency at a party congress in September 2022. The internal opponents of the party leadership included, among others, [[Rui Maria de Araújo]], [[Osório Florindo]], and [[Luís Maria Lobato]]. [[Lere Anan Timur]] was also present at a meeting of the inner-party opposition. The former general had run against his party colleague Guterres in the last presidential election, but presented himself as a member of a leadership troika with Alkatiri and Guterres during the parliamentary election.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web |date=2023-05-23 |title=Oposição na Fretilin quer demissão de liderança após derrota "humilhante" |url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/oposicao-na-fretilin-quer-demissao-de-lideranca-apos-derrota-humilhante_n1488422 |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=RTP |language=pt}}</ref>

The outgoing government is said to have suffered as a result of the electorate's dissatisfaction with the instability of its member parties, which were held responsible for disrupting the functioning of the institutions in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web  |date=2023-05-24 |title=Timor-Leste's opposition party wins election 'punishing' ruling Fretilin coalition |website=Asia Pacific Report |url=https://asiapacificreport.nz/2023/05/24/timor-lestes-opposition-party-wins-election-in-major-upset-to-ruling-coalition/ |access-date=2023-05-30 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":14" /> After acknowledging the results, [[Fidelis Leite Magalhães]], [[Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Timor-Leste)|Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers]], said the previous government would work with the future one to ensure a "dignified and quality [[Peaceful transition of power|transition]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lusa |date=23 May 2023 |title=Governo vai cooperar para transição condigna e de qualidade – ministro |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/291447921596101/posts/1456774121730136/ |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=Facebook |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Meilana |first=Gantry |date=24 May 2023 |title=Timor-Leste's Opposition Party Wins Most Seats in Parliamentary Election |url=https://thediplomat.com/2023/05/timor-lestes-opposition-party-wins-most-seats-in-parliamentary-election/ |access-date=2023-05-30 |website=thediplomat.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

However, the date of the inauguration of the new MPs had to be set by Speaker Lopes and after the elections there were demands from the old governing parties to postpone the date to September. According to them, the current legislative period would last that long. In the meantime, the old government used the time after the elections to discuss new laws. President Ramos-Horta insisted on being sworn in within two weeks of the election, in accordance with the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PR timorense contra adiamento de tomada de posse de novos deputados |url=https://24.sapo.pt/noticias/pr-timorense-contra-adiamento-de-tomada-de_6479bd1da68aa948e016a97b |access-date=2023-06-11 |website=SAPO 24 |language=pt}}</ref> The Supreme Court confirmed the results of the elections on 5 June as the last formal step for their validity.<ref>{{Cite web |work=A Semana |title=Timor-Leste/Eleições: Tribunal de Recurso certifica resultados definitivos das legislativas - Primeiro diário caboverdiano em linha|url=https://www.asemana.publ.cv/?Timor-Leste-Eleicoes-Tribunal-de-Recurso-certifica-resultados-definitivos-das&ak=1 |access-date=2023-06-11}}</ref> The next day, after a meeting lasting more than two and a half hours, the leaders of the parliamentary groups agreed on 22 June as the date for the inauguration.

The decision of 5 June was only published in the [[Jornal da República]] the following day, so the latest date was 21 June.
