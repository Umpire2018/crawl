==Aftermath==
According to official results shared by the [[National Elections Authority]], turnout was 66.8%, eclipsing the turnout from the [[2012 Egyptian presidential election|2012 presidential election]] that followed the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]. Egyptian media portrayed the election as a "great victory for the will of the people," who were reportedly motivated to vote because of the country's "state of stability and security." The opposition described the election as a "[[Sham election|farce]]", marred by corrupt practices and intimidation of el-Sisi's opponents, similar to the [[2018 Egyptian presidential election|2018 presidential election]]. Multiple voters interviewed at the entrance to several polling stations admitted that they had been paid between 200 and 300 [[Egyptian pound]]s (US$6.46 to $9.69<!-- 6 to 9 euros, or 5.15 to 7.72 British pounds -->) by supporters of el-Sisi to come and vote. There were also reports that security forces forcibly escorted people waiting at bus stops or train stations to polling stations for voting, and that civil servants were required to prove that they had voted by showing their finger marked with [[election ink]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-13 |title=Présidentielle en Égypte : un taux de participation " historique " |trans-title=Egypt's presidential election: "historic" turnout |url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1514367/politique/presidentielle-en-egypte-un-taux-de-participation-historique/ |access-date=2023-12-25 |website=JeuneAfrique |language=fr-FR}}</ref>
