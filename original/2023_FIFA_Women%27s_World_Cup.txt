The tournament is contested with eight [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] groups followed by a [[single-elimination tournament|knockout round]] for 16 teams. The defending champions were the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], who defeated the [[Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands]] 2–0 in the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup final|2019 final]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/07/us-defeats-netherlands-2-0-in-fifa-womens-world-cup.html |title=US defeats Netherlands to win record 4th Women's World Cup title |publisher=CNBC |date=7 July 2019 |access-date=19 June 2023 |archive-date=19 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230619044715/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/07/us-defeats-netherlands-2-0-in-fifa-womens-world-cup.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="48897032b"/> The event took place over a period of a month, from 20 July to 20 August, in Australia and New Zealand.

In addition, it was the first senior tournament to be held in [[Oceania]], the first Women's World Cup in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the third to be held in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, after [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]].

The opening match of the tournament, between co-host New Zealand and Norway, was [[2023 FIFA Women's World Cup Group A#New Zealand vs Norway|played]] on 20 July 2023 at [[Eden Park]].

===Prize money===
The total prize pool was [[United States dollar|USD]] 110 million, $80 million greater than the prize pool of the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup|previous tournament]].<ref name=":4">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/media-releases/new-payment-model-guarantees-support-for-every-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-tm |title=New payment model guarantees support for every FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 team and player |publisher=FIFA |date=9 June 2023 |access-date=18 June 2023 |archive-date=18 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230618140208/https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/media-releases/new-payment-model-guarantees-support-for-every-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-tm |url-status=live }}</ref>

At previous tournaments, FIFA paid total prize money to the national associations, but for the 2023 Women's World Cup it was set to award prize payments directly to players as well as the associations. This came as a result of reports in the women's game that a number of national associations were withholding competition prize money from players and/or not paying them at all.<ref name=":4" /> In March 2023, global player union [[FIFPRO]] sent a letter signed by players from around the world to FIFA, challenging FIFA to make prize money in the men's and women's tournaments equal and to ensure at least 30% of prize money in the women's tournament made it to the players. While FIFA did not match the prize money of the men's tournament, it did significantly increase it, with more than half set to be paid to players directly.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cootes |first=Isobel |date=16 July 2023 |title=What players at the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 will be paid |url=https://sport.optus.com.au/news/womens-world-cup-2023/os58570/wwc-what-players-at-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-will-be-paid |website=Optus Sports |access-date=17 July 2023 |archive-date=17 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230717041307/https://sport.optus.com.au/news/womens-world-cup-2023/os58570/wwc-what-players-at-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-will-be-paid |url-status=live }}</ref>

Just before the tournament, FIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] announced that the player payments would still be paid to the associations, and that FIFA planned to audit the associations to make sure the money got to the players. Football administrator [[Lise Klaveness]] expressed concern over what she felt sounded like reneging on the promise, both for the players and for FIFA's credibility.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kunti |first=Samindra |title=Lise Klaveness: FIFA Must Stick To Prize Money Promises At Women's World Cup |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samindrakunti/2023/07/24/lise-klaveness-fifa-must-stick-to-prize-money-promises-at-womens-world-cup/ |access-date=27 July 2023 |website=Forbes |archive-date=27 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727015816/https://www.forbes.com/sites/samindrakunti/2023/07/24/lise-klaveness-fifa-must-stick-to-prize-money-promises-at-womens-world-cup/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During the tournament, Infantino admitted that FIFA had simply made recommendations to associations on how much to pay players, and they could not reasonably check.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aarons |first1=Ed |last2=Molina |first2=Romain |date=3 August 2023 |title=Fifa investigating claims Zambia coach rubbed player's chest at World Cup |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/03/fifa-investigating-claims-zambia-coach-bruce-mwape-rubbed-players-chest-womens-world-cup |access-date=5 August 2023 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=5 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230805040038/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/03/fifa-investigating-claims-zambia-coach-bruce-mwape-rubbed-players-chest-womens-world-cup |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 31 July, the [[FIFA Council]] unanimously decided to expand the tournament to 32 teams, featuring eight groups of four.<ref name="expanded">{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/fifa-council-unanimously-approves-the-expansion-of-the-fifa-women-s-world-cup-to |title=FIFA Council unanimously approves expanded 32-team field for FIFA Women's World Cup |website=FIFA.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |date=31 July 2019 |access-date=31 July 2019 |archive-date=9 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609024823/https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/fifa-council-unanimously-approves-the-expansion-of-the-fifa-women-s-world-cup-to |url-status=live }}</ref>

The tournament opened with a group stage consisting of eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams progressing from each group to a [[Elimination tournament|knockout tournament]] featuring 16 teams. The number of games played overall increased from 52 to 64. The tournament replicated the format of the men's [[FIFA World Cup]] used between [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]. For the first time since the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], both qualified teams from each group were kept on the same side of the draw in the knockout stage, meaning they could potentially meet again in the semi-final. This was to minimise travel between Australia and New Zealand and to ensure both host nations remained in their own country up to the semi-finals should they qualify.<ref name="ath-faq">{{cite news |url=https://theathletic.com/4484600/2023/06/01/womens-world-cup-2023-faq/ |title=Women's World Cup 2023: Everything you need to know (and some things you didn't) |work=[[The Athletic]] |first=Ed |last=Mackey |date=1 June 2023 |access-date=5 June 2023 |archive-date=6 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606005709/https://theathletic.com/4484600/2023/06/01/womens-world-cup-2023-faq/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Squads===
{{Main|2023 FIFA Women's World Cup squads}}

Each team had to provide to FIFA a preliminary squad of between 35 and 55 players, which FIFA did not publish. From the preliminary squad, each team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 9 July 2023. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/7444397eecf3d01e/original/FWWC2023_Regulations_EN.pdf|title=Regulations – FIFA Women's World Cup AU NZ 23|publisher=FIFA|access-date=30 May 2023|archive-date=14 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221214220104/https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/7444397eecf3d01e/original/FWWC2023_Regulations_EN.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Retired American international and two-time Women's World Cup winner [[Carli Lloyd]] and [[CNN International]] sports presenter [[Amanda Davies]] conducted the draw. Each confederation had a retired international representing them as a draw assistant: [[Maia Jackman]] of New Zealand for the OFC and [[Julie Dolan]] of Australia for the AFC, alongside men's internationals [[Ian Wright]] of England for UEFA, [[Alexi Lalas]] of the United States for CONCACAF, [[Geremi]] of Cameroon for the CAF and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] winner [[Gilberto Silva]] of Brazil for CONMEBOL.

For the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]] of 13 October 2022. Pot one contained both co-hosts New Zealand and Australia (both automatically placed in positions A1 and B1, respectively) along with the best six teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams being allocated into the following pot (pot three). Pot four contained the lowest ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the three inter-confederation play-off winners. With the exception of UEFA, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn in the same group. However, since each inter-confederation play-off group contained multiple confederations, the placeholders were identified by the seeded teams in their respective play-off pathways to avoid any draw constraints. The draw started with pot one and ended with pot four, with the team selected being allocated to the first available group alphabetically. Pot 1 teams were automatically drawn to position 1 of each group, with the following positions drawn for the remaining pots. The pots for the draws are shown below.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/womens-world-ranking-october-2022-womens-world-cup-draw-seedings |title=Women's Draw Seedings FIFA Women's World Cup Australia New Zealand 2023 |publisher=FIFA |date=14 October 2022 |access-date=14 October 2022 |archive-date=16 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221216173724/https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/womens-world-ranking-october-2022-womens-world-cup-draw-seedings |url-status=live }}</ref>

The VAR at the tournament had the spoken explanations broadcast in the stadium and on television as part of a year-long trial of the technique intended to give more transparency to often-controversial decisions.

===Branding===
The official emblem was jointly designed by [[Toronto]]-based studio Public Address and [[Los Angeles]]-based Works Creative Agency and unveiled on 28 October 2021 during a live show. The emblem featured a football encircled by 32 coloured squares, reflecting the expanded field of the tournament, and the natural terrains of the two host nations. The overall branding of the tournament featured designs reflecting the host nations' Indigenous peoples, created by Australian [[Kalkatungu]] artist Chern'ee Sutton and Māori artist Fiona Collis. Furthermore, the tournament's branding also incorporated the native names of all host cities. Alongside the emblem, the official slogan of the tournament, "Beyond Greatness", reflected FIFA's goal for the event to further expand the prominence of women's football, was also revealed.<ref>{{cite news|date=28 October 2021|title=Australia-NZ unveils '23 Women's World Cup logo|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-womens-world-cup/story/4507866/australia-new-zealand-unveils-2023-womens-world-cup-logo|access-date=4 January 2022|website=ESPN|archive-date=4 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104030753/https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-womens-world-cup/story/4507866/australia-new-zealand-unveils-2023-womens-world-cup-logo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beyond Greatness in 2023|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/media-releases/new-brand-identity-launched-for-fifa-womens-world-cup|url-status=live|access-date=4 January 2022|website=FIFA.com|archive-date=6 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230806022858/https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/media-releases/new-brand-identity-launched-for-fifa-womens-world-cup}}</ref> The names of the host cities in their native names (the local [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] and [[Māori language|Māori]] in New Zealand) were used as part of the official branding.<ref name="first-nations"/>

===Broadcasting rights===
{{main|2023 FIFA Women's World Cup broadcasting rights}}
The 2023 Women's World Cup was the first Women's World Cup to have its broadcasting rights sold as a standalone product rather than being packaged as a bonus of purchasing broadcasting rights for the Men's World Cup. FIFA stated that they saw "huge interest" in the separate bidding process and hoped for more regional partners to sign on. FIFA set an aim to reach a global audience of 2&nbsp;billion, up from 1.12&nbsp;billion at the previous edition of the tournament in France.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-11 |title=With 100 days to Women's World Cup, calls for gender equity grow |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/4/11/womens-world-cup-australia-new-zealand-gender-equity |website=Al Jazeera |access-date=18 May 2023 |archive-date=18 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518130954/https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/4/11/womens-world-cup-australia-new-zealand-gender-equity |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2022, FIFA rejected multiple bids from various public and private broadcasters for what it described as significantly under-priced bids, urging broadcasters to bid more, saying it is what the women's game deserves.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-20 |title=FIFA urges broadcasters pay what the women's game deserves |url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/fifa-urges-broadcasters-pay-what-womens-game-deserves-2023-world-cup-rights-2022-10-20/ |website=Reuters |access-date=22 October 2022 |archive-date=22 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022023949/https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/fifa-urges-broadcasters-pay-what-womens-game-deserves-2023-world-cup-rights-2022-10-20/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Some European broadcasters were concerned about the timezone difference affecting viewership figures, something that was not an issue with the France-hosted 2019 Women's World Cup, while Gianni Infantino threatened a media blackout for Europe's "[[Big Five (association football)|big five]]" (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) if they did not offer more.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Ingle |first=Sean |date=2023-05-02 |title=Fifa threatens Women's World Cup broadcast blackout in Europe |language=en-GB |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/02/fifa-threatens-womens-world-cup-broadcast-blackout-in-europe-offers-rights-infantino |access-date=2023-05-16 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=16 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516172839/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/02/fifa-threatens-womens-world-cup-broadcast-blackout-in-europe-offers-rights-infantino |url-status=live }}</ref> The issue was resolved by the middle of June 2023, five weeks before the tournament, with all territories having deals.<ref>{{cite news|title=FIFA and EBU extend agreement for FIFA Women's World Cup rights and commit to promoting women's football|url=https://www.ebu.ch/news/2023/06/fifa-and-ebu-extend-agreement-for-fifa-womens-world-cup-rights-and-commit-to-promoting-womens-football|access-date=15 June 2023|work=EBU|date=14 June 2023|archive-date=14 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230614195619/https://www.ebu.ch/news/2023/06/fifa-and-ebu-extend-agreement-for-fifa-womens-world-cup-rights-and-commit-to-promoting-womens-football|url-status=live}}</ref> A deal between Japanese broadcaster NHK and FIFA was announced for the last uncovered major market a week before start of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHK to Broadcast All Nadeshiko Games|url=https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/sports/soccer-worldcup/20230714-122750/|access-date=15 July 2023|work=[[The Yomiuri Shimbun]]|publisher=The Japan News|date=14 July 2023|archive-date=15 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715043441/https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/sports/soccer-worldcup/20230714-122750/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Match ball===
[[File:2023-07-07 Fussball, Frauen, Länderspiel, Deutschland - Sambia 1DX 6938 by Stepro.jpg|left|thumb|[[Adidas Oceaunz]]]]
On 24 January 2023, The word "[[Oceaunz]]" was unveiled as the [[List of FIFA World Cup official match balls|official match ball]] for the tournament by [[Adidas]].<ref name=":0" />

Oceaunz's design was inspired by the unique natural landscapes of the two host nations, with visuals nodding to the vast mountains of New Zealand and Australia's connection with the Indian Ocean. Its name was a portmanteau based on the tournament's geographical location: [[Oceania]], Australia, and New Zealand. Oceaunz featured the same connected ball technology as was seen in Qatar at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. This provided precise ball data, which was made available to video assistant referees in real-time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/official-match-ball-for-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-australia-new-zealand-unveiled-by-adidas|title=Official Match Ball for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 unveiled by adidas|access-date=5 April 2023|archive-date=18 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318113952/https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/official-match-ball-for-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-australia-new-zealand-unveiled-by-adidas|url-status=live}}</ref> It was previously used at the [[2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

The match ball for the semi-finals, third place match, and final, the [[Oceaunz Final Pro]], was revealed on 14 August 2023.

Football Australia CEO [[James Johnson (sports administrator)|James Johnson]] indicated early on in planning that displaying flags representing [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Indigenous New Zealanders (disambiguation)|Indigenous New Zealanders]]<!-- Deliberate link to disambiguation page --> was important to the host nations, and were discussing with FIFA whether this would be permitted at the same time as they and others were [[List of 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup controversies#OneLove armband|discussing captain's armbands]].<ref name=":3" /> A captain's armband highlighting rights for Indigenous peoples was approved by FIFA in June 2023,<ref>{{Cite news|date=30 June 2023|title=FIFA allows anti-discrimination armbands at Women's World Cup|access-date=2023-07-25|work=Al Jazeera|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/30/fifa-allows-anti-discrimination-armbands-at-womens-world-cup|archive-date=25 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725044850/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/30/fifa-allows-anti-discrimination-armbands-at-womens-world-cup|url-status=live}}</ref> with Australian Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] flags ([[Australian Aboriginal flag]] and [[Torres Strait Islander flag]]), and New Zealand [[Māori culture|Māori]] flag ([[Tino Rangatiratanga (flag)|Tino Rangatiratanga]]) approved in July 2023. The extended wait for approval, especially after the armband decision had been announced, prompted Football Australia to seek further clarification.

===Player advocacy===
{{For|advocacy related to controversial issues|List of 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup controversies}}
====Climate action====
On 13 July 2023, a group of 44 players, led by Denmark's [[Sofie Junge Pedersen]] and facilitated by [[Common Goal (charity)|Common Goal]] and [[Football for Future]], announced that they would combat the [[carbon footprint]] of the teams' flights to Australia and New Zealand by donating to "[[climate resilience]] and [[carbon offsetting]] initiatives" organised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and [[DanChurchAid]].<ref name=":2" /> Having donated to offset carbon emissions every time her team required flights for five years before the 2023 Women's World Cup,<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Sofie Junge Pedersen interview: Denmark midfielder on leading historic climate action ahead of the Women's World Cup |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37390/12920007/sofie-junge-pedersen-interview-denmark-midfielder-on-leading-historic-climate-action-ahead-of-the-womens-world-cup |date=13 July 2023 |access-date=21 July 2023 |website=Sky Sports |archive-date=14 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230714223826/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37390/12920007/sofie-junge-pedersen-interview-denmark-midfielder-on-leading-historic-climate-action-ahead-of-the-womens-world-cup |url-status=live }}</ref> Junge Pedersen decided to reach out to her national and club teammates to do the same when faced with the long flights to Australia and New Zealand and the prominence of the tournament. Announcing the initiative, she hoped other players would join them in donating before and during the World Cup. She and Canada's [[Jessie Fleming]] discussed their hope to leave a positive environmental impact, acknowledging that the donations were short-term fixes for one issue, and their hope that there will be more climate-positive developments in football.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |date=13 July 2023 |title=Women's World Cup stars to offset climate impact of flights to tournament |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-climate-change-b2374548.html |access-date=14 July 2023 |website=The Independent |archive-date=14 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230714222651/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/womens-world-cup-climate-change-b2374548.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":3" />

The group of players also petitioned football governing bodies to make carbon concerns a more important factor in the bidding processes for future tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |last=Onyeagwara |first=Nnamdi |title=Women's World Cup stars create player-led climate action initiative |url=https://theathletic.com/4685745/2023/07/13/womens-world-cup-climate-change/ |date=13 July 2023 |access-date=14 July 2023 |website=The Athletic |archive-date=14 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230714223827/https://theathletic.com/4685745/2023/07/13/womens-world-cup-climate-change/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The initiative was considered the biggest player-led climate campaign in football, especially with the 44 players coming from a variety of nations and working together.

====Germany grassroots====
Also facilitated by Common Goal, the [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] team announced before their opening match that they would donate 1% of their FIFA-guaranteed earnings from the tournament to Futbalo Girls and Girl Power, [[grassroots]] football programmes for young girls and non-binary people.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-24 |title=Germany players commit some of their Women's World Cup bonuses to grassroots programs |url=https://apnews.com/article/womens-world-cup-germany-bonuses-grassroots-11614032976da95fb3b56bf415b1fadb |access-date=2023-07-25 |website=AP News |language=en |archive-date=25 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725033831/https://apnews.com/article/womens-world-cup-germany-bonuses-grassroots-11614032976da95fb3b56bf415b1fadb |url-status=live }}</ref>
