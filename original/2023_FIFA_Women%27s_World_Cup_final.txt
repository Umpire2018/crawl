The '''2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final''' was an [[Women's association football|association football]] match that determined the winner of the [[2023 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. The match was played at the [[Stadium Australia]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, on 20 August 2023, and was contested by [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]] and [[England women's national football team|England]]. It took place in front of 75,784 supporters, and Spain won the final 1–0 through a goal from [[Olga Carmona]], assisted by [[Mariona Caldentey]].

For both finalists, this was the first appearance in a Women's World Cup final. Both teams were looking to become only the second country to win both [[FIFA World Cup|men's]] and women's World Cups – Germany accomplished the feat in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] – as well as becoming the first team representing [[UEFA]] to win the tournament since [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup final|2007]]. This was the third all-European final in the Women's World Cup, after the [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final|1995]] and [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup final|2003]] finals, both of which were also contested between potential new champions.

===Officials===
On 18 August 2023, FIFA named American official [[Tori Penso]] as the referee for the final.

===Team selection===
From their 2022 Women's Euro team that beat Spain in [[Brighton and Hove]] before winning that tournament, England could not call up captain [[Leah Williamson]], player of the tournament and top scorer [[Beth Mead]], or [[Fran Kirby]] due to knee injuries. The World Cup squad included some returning senior players and new young players instead. One of the young players called up after the 2022 Euro, [[Lauren James]], was available to play in the final after a straight red card against Nigeria in the round of 16 resulted in her being suspended for the quarter-final and semi-final.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Braidwood |first1=Jamie |title=Lauren James 'will be ready' for World Cup final, says Chelsea manager Emma Hayes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/lauren-james-england-womens-world-cup-final-b2395164.html |access-date=22 August 2023 |publisher=Independent |date=20 August 2023}}</ref>

Following the 2022 Euro, a group of 15 Spain players boycotted matches due to a dispute with the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) and manager [[Jorge Vilda]].

===Representatives===
Both England (as part of the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth]]) and Spain are [[constitutional monarchies]] and are often represented at sporting events by members of their royal families. At the time, the president of the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) was [[Luis Rubiales]], while [[William, Prince of Wales]] was president of [[The Football Association]] (The FA). Despite his position in football and as royalty, William said he would not travel to Australia (of which he is also royalty) to watch England in the final, citing the [[carbon footprint]] that would be generated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Klein-Nixon |first=Kylie |date=2023-08-19 |title='Large carbon footprint' behind Prince William not attending World Cup final |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/fifa-womens-world-cup-2023/132776452/large-carbon-footprint-behind-prince-william-not-attending-world-cup-final |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=Stuff |language=en}}</ref>

Rubiales had accompanied the Spain team throughout much of their time in New Zealand and Australia, with a report in [[Relevo]] suggesting he had imposed his presence around the players too closely, behaving more like a teammate than the president, and had normalised a level of paternalism and condescension.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-21 |title=No solo fue el beso: los gestos de Rubiales provocan una crisis y emborronan el título Mundial |url=https://www.relevo.com/futbol/mundial-femenino/campeonas-mundo-habla-desagrable-avergonzante-20230821100415-nt.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=Relevo |language=es}}</ref> Spain's [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Letizia]] travelled to Australia for the final with her younger daughter, the [[Infanta Sofía of Spain|Infanta Sofía]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Queen Letizia and Infanta Sofía will travel to Australia to support Spain in the World Cup final {{!}} www.rfef.es/en |url=https://rfef.es/en/noticias/queen-letizia-and-infanta-sofia-will-travel-to-australia-to-support-spain-in-the-world-cup-final |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=EN Web oficial de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol. |language=en}}</ref> Included in the trip over her sister, Sofía is known to be a big fan of football as well as reportedly an aspiring [[defensive midfielder]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-20 |title=Así saca partido la infanta Sofía a la final del Mundial de fútbol femenino en la que se desmarca de Leonor |url=https://www.lecturas.com/actualidad/casas-reales/asi-saca-partido-infanta-sofia-final-mundial-futbol-femenino-que-se-desmarca-leonor_143652 |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=Lecturas |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-20 |title=La infanta Sofía, la gran forofa de la selección española en el Mundial femenino: "Estoy deseando ir al vestuario" |url=https://www.larazon.es/gente/casa-real/infanta-sofia-gran-forofa-seleccion-espanola-mundial-femenino-estoy-deseando-vestuario_2023082064e1e5725df8e30001d94334.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=www.larazon.es |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sofía de Borbón: pivote defensivo |url=https://alacontra.es/publicaciones/ver-articulo/sofia-de-borbon-pivote-defensivo/andrea-menendez |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=alacontra.es |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Fernández-Pello |first=Elena |date=2023-08-21 |title=Sofía, la infanta que sueña con ser futbolista y vibró en Australia |url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/gente/20230821/sofia-infanta-suena-futbolista-vibro-australia-91197633 |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=elperiodico |language=es}}</ref> The director of women's football for Barcelona, [[Xavi Puig]], was also in attendance and allowed to accompany the Spain team, though stated to be supporting all the club's players.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-21 |title=El Barça acompañó a las azulgrana en Sídney |url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20230821/1002055349/barca-acompano-azulgrana-sidney.html |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=Mundo Deportivo |language=es}}</ref>

==Match==
===Summary===
The match was described as a "pulsating game", difficult but with Spain creating more clear chances by the end.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pal |first=Alasdair |date=2023-08-20 |title=Spain defeat England in final of record-breaking Women's World Cup |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/england-spain-final-round-off-record-breaking-womens-world-cup-2023-08-20/}}</ref>

England started the match intensely, with Spain patient;<ref name=":3" /> the first shot of the game came in the 5th minute from England forward [[Lauren Hemp]] shooting straight at Spain goalkeeper [[Cata Coll]]. Spain took advantage of the transition a minute later to launch a counterattack that saw centre forward [[Alba Redondo]] send in a loose cross. England then created chances with balls played through the lines to centre forward [[Alessia Russo]]; when Spain got the ball they held possession without taking advantage. After England holding midfielder [[Keira Walsh]] was fouled by [[Salma Paralluelo]] attempting to dispossess her, the England team created their best chance of the match, with Hemp having a clear shot on goal in the 16th minute but striking the crossbar.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2023-08-20 |title=England v Spain LIVE: Women's World Cup final result and reaction |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/england-spain-live-score-womens-world-cup-final-b2396015.html |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=The Independent}}</ref> The match "sprung into life" when Spain made their first substantial attack a minute later, with vice-captain [[Olga Carmona]] crossing a ball to Paralluelo, who could not connect fully but sent the ball into the path of Redondo: England goalkeeper [[Mary Earps]] made a quick-moving save to catch the shot from Redondo. Over the next few minutes, the match was played from end to end, with chances in for both teams.<ref name=":1" />

When England right wing-back [[Lucy Bronze]] attempted a dribble through the midfield, Spanish players dispossessed her and the ball was sent to Carmona, who took a tight-angled low shot past Earps and into the right corner of the net, scoring the only goal of the match in the 29th minute.<ref name=":1" /> Spanish media noted that although Spain's team featured more players from Barcelona than any other club, the goal did not come from possession play but from a quick counterattack, more like the play of [[Real Madrid Femenino|Real Madrid]], which the Spain women's team had increasingly played like.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=García |first=Pablo Macías |date=2023-08-20 |title=España vence a Inglaterra y se proclama campeona del Mundial de Australia y Nueva Zelanda |url=https://elpais.com/deportes/mundial-futbol-femenino/2023-08-20/espana-inglaterra-en-directo-final-del-mundial-de-australia-y-nueva-zelanda-en-vivo.html |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=El País |language=es}}</ref> England struggled after conceding the goal, allowing a confident Spain more chances,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /> though Spain's only shot on target in the rest of the half came when defender [[Irene Paredes]] was given space in the box to head the ball from a free kick in the 37th minute, which Earps kept out. England recovered close to the end of the first half, and a long ball to Hemp was crossed in for [[Ella Toone]] with an empty goal in the 42nd minute, though Toone failed to connect and the ball was recovered by Spain; the same sequence was used minutes later, with Spain sending players into the box to clear Hemp's cross. In the one minute of added time at the end of the first half, Paralluelo also hit the crossbar.<ref name=":1" />

Returning from half time, England changed formation from the 3–5–2 that they had adopted in the group stage, returning to the 4–3–3 they had consistently used under Wiegman throughout her tenure. Wingers [[Lauren James]] and [[Chloe Kelly]] came on for left wing-back [[Rachel Daly]] and Russo. The change initially saw England improve defensively and create better opportunities, including the fullbacks continuing to play forward; Spain substituted centre forward Redondo for defensive player [[Oihane Hernández]] in the 60th minute, with Spain attacking midfielder [[Aitana Bonmatí]] trying to score from range in the 62nd minute. England's confidence waned and Spain's was bolstered when Walsh conceded a penalty for accidental handball in the box while defending a corner in the 65th minute.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news |title=Lionesses miss opportunity to cement legend status |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66562418 |access-date=2023-08-20}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> After a lengthy [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] review, Spain forward [[Jennifer Hermoso]] took the penalty in the 70th minute, with the shot saved by Earps. Spain defender [[Laia Codina]] was treated and eventually substituted with an injury in the 73rd minute, being replaced by captain [[Ivana Andrés]]. England briefly found form again after the substitution, with James able to send in a tight-angled shot narrowly saved by Coll, but were hampered by defender [[Alex Greenwood]] receiving a head injury from Paralluelo's high knee in the 78th minute. Greenwood managed to continue, with play resuming in the 82nd minute and England playing desperately.<ref name=":1" />

Spain had the better of the game for the rest of the 90, and when Hermoso required treatment, England replaced Toone with striker [[Bethany England]] in the 87th minute. An attempt from Hermoso was impressively blocked by [[Jess Carter]] in the 89th minute, before [[Alexia Putellas]] was brought on for [[Mariona Caldentey]] in the 90th. Accounting for the VAR and treatment time, there were 13 minutes of added time at the end of the match. England continued to play desperately, leaving defensive gaps, with Earps saving a low shot from Spain fullback [[Ona Batlle]] in the 92nd minute. Spain used their control to slow the game and frustrate England, with England's only chance in the added time being a weak Kelly cross cleared by Spain's ample defense; Spain had their own chances in added time, with a sliding block from Bronze preventing Paralluelo's shot in the 98th minute.<ref name=":1" /> England's attacks led to a corner taken in the 104th minute, which was held by Coll and the match ended.<ref name=":3" />

===Incidents===
In the 23rd minute of the match, a man [[Pitch invasion|ran onto the field]] wearing an anti-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] t-shirt, halting play briefly while England was waiting to take a free kick.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-20 |title=Anti-Putin protest interrupts Women's World Cup final |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/protest-putin-pitch-invader-womens-world-cup-b2396199.html |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=The Independent}}</ref> The free kick was gathered by Spain, who counterattacked unsuccessfully.<ref name=":1" />

During a celebration when Spain scored, manager Vilda hugged a female assistant; initially having his hand on her shoulder, he appeared to move it down to her breast and hold this a moment before removing his hand. The moment was captured on camera and re-examined after the match and an incident of Rubiales kissing a player without consent.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-22 |title=Spain boss Jorge Vilda appears to grab breast of female coach during World Cup final |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jorge-vilda-grope-grab-womens-world-cup-spain-b2397138.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first1=Jill |last1=Martin |first2=Matias |last2=Grez |date=2023-08-22 |title=Spain's head coach Jorge Vilda appears to touch female staffer inappropriately during game celebration |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/football/jorge-vilda-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

Near the end of the match, England player Bronze approached Vilda at the side of the pitch and remonstrated him. Coming after several fouls on England, and when Vilda and his staff were crowding the touchline, Bronze told Australian media that she "just told them to sit down".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-21 |title=England star explodes over unseen act late in fiery final |url=https://7news.com.au/sport/fifa-womens-world-cup/england-star-lucy-bronze-fires-up-over-spains-infuriating-act-late-in-fifa-womens-world-cup-final-c-11654907 |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=7NEWS |language=en}}</ref>

The England team stayed overnight in Sydney before returning to London, set to arrive on 22 August; the [[2023–24 Women's Super League|Women's Super League]] would not begin its season until October.

===Rubiales affair===
{{Main|Rubiales affair}}
During the medal ceremony, RFEF president [[Luis Rubiales]] kissed Jennifer Hermoso on the lips. The action drew criticism, particularly towards the continued sexism in the sport, and calls for Rubiales's resignation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Méheut |first=Constant |date=20 August 2023 |title=A Kiss After Spain's World Cup Win Prompts Many to Cry Foul |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/world/europe/hermoso-kiss-world-cup-spain-rubiales.html |accessdate=21 August 2023}}</ref> In a separate incident at the end of the match, Rubiales was filmed pointing to the Spain players before grabbing his crotch, with the obscene gesture further criticised as he was standing next to the teenage [[Infanta Sofía of Spain|Infanta Sofía]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-21 |title=Spanish FA boss who kissed player filmed making obscene gesture |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/luis-rubiales-video-hermoso-kiss-b2396594.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref>

After Hermoso had said she did not expect or like the kiss, Rubiales entered the players' dressing room, reportedly throwing his arm around Hermoso and joking about marrying her in Ibiza.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Filipovic |first=Jill |date=2023-08-22 |title=Opinion: An unwanted kiss on the lips mars Spain's World Cup celebration |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/opinions/spanish-football-federation-kiss-womens-world-cup-filipovic/index.html |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> While on a layover returning from Australia, Rubiales published an apology video in which he said that he had no bad intentions and was sorry for distracting from the celebration, saying: "I have to apologise, learn from this, and understand that when you are president you have to be more careful."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Spanish PM says Rubiales kiss 'unacceptable' |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66581263 |access-date=2023-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-23 |title=La capitana Ivana Andrés también rechazó salir en el vídeo con Rubiales |url=https://www.relevo.com/futbol/mundial-femenino/ivana-andres-rechazo-salir-video-20230823121905-nt.html |access-date=2023-08-24 |website=Relevo |language=es}}</ref>
