== Background ==
Originally, India was scheduled to host the [[List of G20 summits|G20 summit]] in 2021 and Italy in 2022. At the [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit]] in Argentina, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] said he had requested Italy to host the summit in 2021 and allow India to host it in 2022, on the occasion of the 75th year of [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]]. 
Italy agreed to let India host the G20 summit in 2022 in its place, owing to the momentum in bilateral ties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/warmth-in-ties-prompts-italy-to-let-india-host-g20-summit-in-2022/articleshow/66913607.cms?from=mdr|title=Warmth in ties prompts Italy to let India host G20 Summit in 2022|first=Dipanjan Roy|last=Chaudhury|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=3 December 2018|access-date=25 August 2023|archive-date=25 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230825234845/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/warmth-in-ties-prompts-italy-to-let-india-host-g20-summit-in-2022/articleshow/66913607.cms?from=mdr|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, after a request made by [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Foreign Minister]] [[Retno Marsudi]], India exchanged its presidency of the G20 with Indonesia because Indonesia would also chair the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 2023.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-india-swap-g-20-upcoming-presidency-term|title=Indonesia, India swap G-20 upcoming presidency term|date=23 November 2020|newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=25 August 2023|archive-date=25 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230825234845/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-india-swap-g-20-upcoming-presidency-term|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Presidency ==
The G20 New Delhi Summit was chaired by the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. India's presidency began on 1 December 2022, leading up to the summit in the third quarter of 2023.

Indonesia held the presidency in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anuj |date=2022-12-12 |title=India's G20 Presidency and {{as written|I|t's [sic]}} Implications |url=https://pashubazzar.in/2022/12/12/indias-g20-presidency-and-its-implications/ |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=Perfect Review |language=en-US |archive-date=12 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221212065539/https://pashubazzar.in/2022/12/12/indias-g20-presidency-and-its-implications/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
