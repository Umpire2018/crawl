== Background ==
{{main|2016 Gabonese presidential election|2016 Gabonese protests}}

The previous presidential election was held on 27 August 2016. On the day after the elections, opposition leader [[Jean Ping]] declared victory and said that he was "waiting for the outgoing president to call to congratulate me," although no results had been officially announced.<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/news/bongos-fate-balance-gabon-goes-polls-031021418.html Gabon opposition chief claims election victory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217160304/https://www.yahoo.com/news/bongos-fate-balance-gabon-goes-polls-031021418.html |date=2017-02-17 }} Agence France-Presse, 28 August 2016</ref> Only the electoral commission was legally permitted to announce results, and the Minister of the Interior, [[Pacôme Moubelet-Boubeya]], accused Ping of "attempt[ing] to manipulate the democratic process," while Bongo said that "you must not sell the skin of the bear before you've killed him." Nevertheless, Bongo's spokesman, Alain Claude Bilie By Nzé, asserted that Bongo was ahead and would be re-elected.<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/news/gabon-opposition-candidate-says-hes-winning-presidential-vote-142821755.html Gabon leader and top rival both claim presidential victory, allege fraud] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222003602/https://www.yahoo.com/news/gabon-opposition-candidate-says-hes-winning-presidential-vote-142821755.html |date=22 December 2022 }} Reuters, 28 August 2016</ref> Official results were scheduled to be announced on 30 August, but on that date it was stated that the announcement would be delayed by a few hours.<ref>[http://www.africanews.com/2016/08/30/gabon-s-interior-minister-postpones-announcement-of-presidential-polls-amid/ Gabon's interior minister postpones announcement of presidential polls amid tension] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222003607/http://www.africanews.com/2016/08/30/gabon-s-interior-minister-postpones-announcement-of-presidential-polls-amid/ |date=22 December 2022 }} Africanews, 30 August 2016</ref> Results were finally announced on 31 August, showing a narrow victory for Bongo, who won 49.8% of the vote against 48.2% for Ping. Turnout was placed at 59.5%. The opposition's representatives on the electoral commission refused to confirm the results, and they were therefore confirmed by a vote in which the opposition members abstained. Ping's supporters maintained that the mostly complete results they had independently collected showed their candidate beating Bongo by a large margin, 59% to 38%.<ref name="Fire">Gerauds Wilfried Obangome, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gabon-election-idUSKCN1160DT "Gabon's President Bongo re-elected, parliament set on fire"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222003602/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gabon-election-idUSKCN1160DT |date=22 December 2022 }}, Reuters, 31 August 2016.</ref> Notably, the official results from [[Haut-Ogooue Province|Haut-Ogooue]] (the Bongo family's native province) showed Bongo receiving 95.5% of the vote on an alleged 99.9% turnout, an improbable result sparking widespread protests.<ref>Celia Lebur and Samir Tounsi, [https://www.yahoo.com/news/tensions-high-tight-gabon-vote-enters-final-stretch-104022163.html "Gabon parliament set ablaze after Bongo declared winner"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920215455/https://www.yahoo.com/news/tensions-high-tight-gabon-vote-enters-final-stretch-104022163.html |date=2016-09-20 }}, Agence France-Presse, 31 August 2016.</ref> Bongo, noting that the vote was close, stressed the importance of peacefully respecting this outcome.<ref name="Fire" />

Along with France and the United States, it called for de-escalation on both sides of the dispute and pressed for more transparent detail on the vote outcome.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gabon violence: Two killed amid protests over re-election of Ali Bongo |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37257494 |access-date=3 September 2016 |archive-date=2 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902215155/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37257494 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Opposition call for fair elections ===
On 12 December 2022, the entire Gabonese opposition gathered in Libreville for the start of a series of meetings in view of the 2023 presidential and legislative elections. This meeting, at the call of the [[National Union (Gabon)|National Union]], brought together fifty parties, including civil society leaders. The meeting was meant to put pressure on the government to reform the electoral process, and remind the public authorities of the need for consultation with the opposition. For Paulette Missambo, president of National Union, urgent reforms were needed in order to ensure a fair election.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-13 |title=Gabon: l'opposition se met en ordre de marche pour des élections « sincères » en 2023 |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20221213-gabon-l-opposition-se-met-en-ordre-de-marche-pour-des-%C3%A9lections-sinc%C3%A8res-en-2023 |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=RFI |language=fr |archive-date=22 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222003602/https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20221213-gabon-l-opposition-se-met-en-ordre-de-marche-pour-des-%C3%A9lections-sinc%C3%A8res-en-2023 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
The [[President of Gabon]] is elected for a five-year term (reduced from seven years in April 2023)<ref>{{cite web |date=2023-04-07 |title=Gabon: Presidential term reduced from seven to five years |url=https://www.africanews.com/2023/04/07/gabon-presidential-term-reduced-from-seven-to-five-years/ |access-date=2023-07-24 |website=Africa News |language=en |archive-date=24 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230724213449/https://www.africanews.com/2023/04/07/gabon-presidential-term-reduced-from-seven-to-five-years/ |url-status=live }}</ref> in a single round of voting by [[Plurality voting system|plurality]]; whichever candidate places first is deemed elected, regardless of whether the candidate secured an absolute majority of votes. This system is thought to be a disadvantage to the fractious opposition, which would appear to have little chance of winning unless it unites behind a single candidate.<ref name="Seek">[http://www.france24.com/en/20160229-gabon-president-ali-bongo-seek-second-term Gabon's President Ali Bongo to seek second term in office] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209050255/http://www.france24.com/en/20160229-gabon-president-ali-bongo-seek-second-term|date=2017-02-09}} France 24, 29 February 2016</ref>

The 143 members of the National Assembly are elected from single-member constituencies using the [[two-round system]].<ref>[http://www.gabonactu.com/communique-final-du-conseil-des-ministres-du-26-janvier-2018-tout-le-texte-decoupage-electoral/ Communiqué final du conseil des ministres du 26 janvier 2018 (Tout le texte + découpage électoral)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809004651/http://www.gabonactu.com/communique-final-du-conseil-des-ministres-du-26-janvier-2018-tout-le-texte-decoupage-electoral/ |date=9 August 2018 }} Gabon Actu, 26 January 2018</ref>

The elections were held using [[double simultaneous vote]] system, with voters casting a single ballot for their preferred candidate for president and National Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-66620070|title=Gabon election: President Ali Bongo aims for third term|website=BBC News|date=26 August 2023|access-date=26 August 2023|archive-date=26 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230826233756/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-66620070|url-status=live}}</ref>
