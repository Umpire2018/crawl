Following a series of heatwaves and wildfires taking place over Europe, wildfires in Greece started on 17 July 2023. The [[Greek government]] established a Crisis Management Unit to respond to the situation. A wildfire that started on the Greek island of Rhodes on 18 July led to the [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of four locations, including two seaside resorts. Approximately 2,000 people, including tourists, were safely evacuated by sea, accounting for less than 10% of the island's tourist accommodations, according to the Fire Corps spokesman.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nellas |first=Demetris |date=22 July 2023 |title=Greek wildfires: Thousands of tourists evacuated as wildfire rages on island of Rhodes |language=en |work=Nzherald |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/greek-wildfires-thousands-of-tourists-evacuated-as-a-wildfire-rages-on-the-greek-island-of-rhodes/UC4DANXBVNCG7CZXFSBK2M3ORU/ |access-date=24 July 2023}}</ref> On 22 August, eighteen bodies were found in a forested area of northern Greece; initial reports suggested those who died may have been migrants.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-08-22 |title=Greece wildfires: Eighteen bodies found in Greek forest |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66579193 |access-date=2023-08-22}}</ref> Additionally, as days passed with more land being burned and property being destroyed more and more, civilians started complaining about the lack of strength in Greece's firefighting capabilities—something that they attribute to government mismanagement.

==Cause==
According to a senior climate crisis official, 667 fires were caused by a "human hand", blaming either negligence or arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/28/greece-fires-arsonists-extreme-weather|title=Most fires in Greece were started 'by human hand', government says|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2023|access-date=3 August 2023}}</ref> 79 arrests were made as of late August.<ref name=BBCAug />

By 25 August, officials had arrested 163 people on fire-related charges since the start of the fire prevention season, including 118 for negligence and 24 for deliberate arson, and the police had made a further 18 arrests according to government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hundreds of firefighters battle raging Greek wildfires |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/27/hundreds-of-firefighters-battle-raging-greek-wildfires |access-date=28 August 2023 |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press in Athens |publisher=Guardian News & Media |date=27 August 2023}}</ref>

Intense winds exacerbated Greece's wildfires, sparking over 50 new blazes amid hot, dry weather; casualties include two deaths and two injured firefighters on August 21, 2023.<ref>{{Cite news |last= Smith |first= Maxine |date=2023-08-16 |title= FirstFT: US presses Iran to stop selling drones to Russia |language=en |work=Financial Times |url= https://www.ft.com/content/fa140f55-d02c-4c64-8176-b5530599e836  |access-date=2023-08-23}}</ref>

==Impact by area==
===Attica===
Three major wildfires broke out in the area of [[Attica (region)|Attica]] on 17 July, in Kalyvia, Loutraki, and Dervenochoria. Greek authorities directed villagers to evacuate their homes in southern Athens. On 20 July, wildfires reignited in Athens as a result of wind, which forced an evacuation effort in the city. On August 22, another major wildfire broke out near Fyli, in a monastery. The 25&nbsp;km/h strong winds made it very difficult to put out and resulted in the area being evacuated. The fire progressed during the night and on August 23 it reached the Parnitha mountain. On August 24 the fire was put out. The fire destroyed a few homes.

===Corfu===
On 23 July, mass evacuations were ordered in [[Corfu]] following major wildfire breakouts on the island.<ref>{{cite news |title=Corfu latest Greek island to evacuate over wildfires |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66286099 |access-date=24 July 2023 |agency=bbc.com |publisher=bbc.com |date=23 July 2023}}</ref>
