== Background ==
{{Further|Trial of Benjamin Netanyahu|2023 Israeli judicial reform|Reactions to the 2023 Israeli judicial reform}}
Since the [[2018–2022 Israeli political crisis|political crisis beginning in 2018]], multiple snap elections were held following unsuccessful attempts to form a [[Coalition government|governing coalition]]. The [[2021 Israeli legislative election|2021 election]] was the first to have resulted in a successful government formation. The incumbent coalition, which held a one-seat majority, collapsed in June 2022 after a member defected. In the [[2022 Israeli legislative election|snap legislative election]] that followed, the [[Thirty-sixth government of Israel|incumbent government]], led by [[Yair Lapid]], was defeated by a coalition of right-wing parties, led by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu,<ref>{{cite news |last=Fitoussi |first=Olivier |date=3 November 2022 |title=Israel election: Final results show Netanyahu bloc at 64 seats |publisher=[[i24NEWS]] |url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israeli-elections/1667497728-israel-election-final-results-show-netanyahu-bloc-at-64-seats |access-date=6 November 2022 |archive-date=4 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221104115132/https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israeli-elections/1667497728-israel-election-final-results-show-netanyahu-bloc-at-64-seats |url-status=live}}</ref> who formed a [[Thirty-seventh government of Israel|new government]] that took office on 29 December 2022.<ref name="BBCswearing">{{Cite news |last1=Knell |first1=Yollande |last2=Gritten |first2=David |date=29 December 2022 |title=Netanyahu's hard-line new government takes office in Israel |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64115141 |access-date=29 December 2022 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archive-date=29 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221229140955/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64115141 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 4 January 2023, newly appointed Justice Minister [[Yariv Levin]] announced [[2023 Israeli judicial reform|plans to reform]] Israel's judiciary, including limiting the power of the Supreme Court and of the government's legal councillors and granting the governing coalition a majority on the committee that appoints judges.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sharon |first=Jeremy |title=Justice minister unveils plan to shackle the High Court, overhaul Israel's judiciary |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/justice-minister-unveils-plan-to-shackle-the-high-court-overhaul-israels-judiciary/ |date=4 January 2023 |access-date=7 February 2023 |website=[[The Times of Israel]] |language=en-US |archive-date=6 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206055057/https://www.timesofisrael.com/justice-minister-unveils-plan-to-shackle-the-high-court-overhaul-israels-judiciary/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Following the announcement, several organisations, including [[Crime Minister]] and [[Standing Together (movement)|Standing Together]], announced their intention to organise protests in [[Tel Aviv]] on 7 January.<ref>{{Cite news |date=7 January 2023 |script-title=he:אלפי מפגינים נגד הממשלה בכיכר הבימה: "זו הפיכה משטרית" |trans-title=Thousands of protesters against the government in Habima Square: 'This is a coup d'état' |url=https://www.ice.co.il/local-news/news/article/924703 |access-date=7 February 2023 |website=Ice |language=he |archive-date=7 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207190118/https://www.ice.co.il/local-news/news/article/924703 |url-status=live}}</ref> On 17 January, the Supreme Court ruled that the recently-appointed Interior Minister [[Aryeh Deri]] was unfit for the position due to his criminal record.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kershner |first=Isabel |date=2023-01-18 |title=Amid Fight Over Judiciary, Israeli High Court Orders Netanyahu Minister Removed |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/world/middleeast/israel-aryeh-deri-netanyahu.html |access-date=2023-07-10 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=17 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230717182647/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/world/middleeast/israel-aryeh-deri-netanyahu.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Netanyahu, who was [[Trial of Benjamin Netanyahu|on trial for corruption-related charges himself]], was forced to withdraw Deri.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |date=2023-07-09 |title=Vor Knesset-Abstimmung – Proteste gegen Justizreform in Israel werden intensiver |url=https://www.srf.ch/news/international/vor-knesset-abstimmung-proteste-gegen-justizreform-in-israel-werden-intensiver |access-date=2023-07-10 |website=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF) |language=de |archive-date=10 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710065353/https://www.srf.ch/news/international/vor-knesset-abstimmung-proteste-gegen-justizreform-in-israel-werden-intensiver |url-status=live }}</ref>

After Netanyahu announced a pause in the judicial legislation on 27 March, counter-protesters started organising their own demonstrations, with tens of thousands protesting in favour of the changes.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=Dan |date=30 March 2023 |title=Israelis backing Netanyahu block highway in counter-protest |publisher=[[Reuters]] |editor-last=Goller |editor-first=Howard |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israelis-backing-netanyahu-block-highway-counter-protest-2023-03-30/ |url-status=bot: unknown |url-access=registration |access-date=30 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403202537/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israelis-backing-netanyahu-block-highway-counter-protest-2023-03-30/ |archive-date=3 April 2023 }}</ref> Negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to pass parts of the legislation; in response, the anti-reform movement ramped up its activities.<ref name=":1" />

Since the beginning of the protest movement against the judicial reform, the link between it and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] was a subject of debate.

''[[The Times of Israel]]'' wrote that protesters were faced with a continuous question of "how much, if at all, should the demonstrations focus on Palestinian rights?"<ref name="TOIHM" /> The debate on what implications the judicial overhaul would have for the Palestinians were discussed on articles and opinion pieces on [[Vox (website)|''Vox'']], ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', and ''[[Haaretz]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/7/26/23807288/israel-judicial-overhaul-settler-agenda-netanyahu-smotrich|title=What Israel's judicial overhaul means for Palestinians|accessdate=23 September 2023|date=26 July 2023|work=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-06-01/ty-article-opinion/.premium/is-judicial-reform-a-trojan-horse-for-west-bank-annexation/00000188-716d-d2d1-afbe-7d6f3e3c0000|title=Is Judicial Reform a Trojan Horse for West Bank Annexation?|accessdate=23 September 2023|date=26 July 2023|work=Yaakov Or}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/07/israel-palestine-protests-judicial-reform-supreme-court-netanyahu-apartheid/|title=Why Palestinians Aren't Joining Israel's Protests|accessdate=23 September 2023|date=7 April 2023|work=Yousef Munayyer}}</ref> Some observers have argued that the reform and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories]] are connected, and that the Israeli government promotes the reform in order to further entrench the occupation.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kretzmer |first=David |date=November 2023 |title=The ‘Constitutional Reform’ and the Occupation |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/israel-law-review/article/constitutional-reform-and-the-occupation/E5D6F5AD85DE8551D8745B66EDA6155F |journal=Israel Law Review |language=en |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=414 |doi=10.1017/S0021223723000109 |issn=0021-2237|doi-access=free }}</ref> Some also argued that the framework of a formal Israeli constitution, a demand of the protesters, would not be achievable until Israel's strategy in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] is changed.<ref name="thb">{{Cite journal |last=Brandes |first=Tamar Hostovsky |date=November 2023 |title=The Constitutional Overhaul and the West Bank: Is Israel's Constitutional Moment Occupied? |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/israel-law-review/article/abs/constitutional-overhaul-and-the-west-bank-is-israels-constitutional-moment-occupied/A62298E9FD1810DCA4560452454EC294 |journal=Israel Law Review |language=en |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=415–425 |doi=10.1017/S0021223723000195 |issn=0021-2237}}</ref>

On 9 August 2023, hundreds of Israeli and American academics published a statement claiming that the ultimate purpose of the judicial overhaul was to "annex more land, and ethnically cleanse all territories under Israeli rule of their Palestinian population".<ref name="WPEC" /><ref name="TGPM" /> The statement characterised that the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza as living under [[Israel and apartheid|apartheid]],<ref name="WPEC" /> and it criticized Jewish American leaders for paying insufficient attention to this "elephant in the room." It also called on them to directly support the Israeli protest movement, while also calling on the protest movement to embrace equality for Palestinians and Jews within Israel and the occupied territories.<ref name="TGPM" /> The initial 800 signatories include Jewish American academics, Israelis, Palestinians, religious leaders, and lawyers.<ref name="TGPM" /> Prominent Israeli signatories included historians [[Ilan Pappé]] and [[Benny Morris]], and former speaker of the [[Knesset]] [[Avraham Burg]].<ref name="TGPM" />

On 3 September 2023, [[Youth Against Dictatorship]] released an open letter signed by 230 Israeli high school students in Tel Aviv, who collectively refused to serve in the IDF, citing their opposition to the judicial reform and a refusal to serve [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlements]].<ref>{{cite news |title=200 teens say they won't enlist, protesting judicial overhaul, control over West Bank |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/teens-say-they-wont-enlist-protesting-judicial-overhaul-and-control-over-west-bank/ |access-date=2023-09-08 |website=[[Times of Israel]]|date=28 August 2023}}</ref> One of the group's members told ''Haaretz'' that the overhaul had led them to connect the reform to the occupation after looking at the politicians pushing the reform, who are all settlers: Smotrich, Rothman and Ben-Gvir.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dayan |first=Linda |date=September 4, 2023 |title='The Overhaul Opened Their Eyes': Israeli Youth Publicly Refuse Draft |language=en |work=[[Haaretz]] |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-04/ty-article/.premium/we-wont-serve-the-dictatorship-in-the-west-bank-israeli-youth-publicly-refuse-draft/0000018a-5e9e-d845-adfe-fefee2380000 |url-status=live |access-date=2023-09-08 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230904085303/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-04/ty-article/.premium/we-wont-serve-the-dictatorship-in-the-west-bank-israeli-youth-publicly-refuse-draft/0000018a-5e9e-d845-adfe-fefee2380000 |archive-date=September 4, 2023}}</ref>
