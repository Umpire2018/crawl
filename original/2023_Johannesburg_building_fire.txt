== Aftermath ==
The fire brought attention to the hundreds of hijacked buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, typically overcrowded and unregulated and inhabited by impoverished and marginalised people including a large number of undocumented migrants to South Africa's economic hub of Johannesburg.<ref name="fire-ramaphosa">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66667934|title=Johannesburg fire 'wake-up call', President Ramaphosa says|publisher=BBC News|last=Granville|first=Samantha|date=31 August 2023|access-date=1 September 2023|archive-date=31 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230831210821/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66667934|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some residents who survived the fire refused to board buses for relocation to emergency accommodation in community halls after the fire, fearing the relocation would be used by officials as an excuse for deportation, and being unwilling to leave behind the remains of their possessions in the burnt building.<ref name="refused-relocation">{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/we-dont-know-how-to-help-them-residents-of-burnt-building-refuse-help-for-fear-of-deportation-20230901|title='We don't know how to help them': Residents of burnt building refuse help for fear of deportation|publisher=News24|first1=Cebelihle|last1=Bhengu|first2=Belinda|last2=Pheto|first3=Alfonso|last3=Nqunjana|date=1 September 2023|access-date=1 September 2023|archive-date=1 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901081611/https://www.news24.com//news24/southafrica/news/we-dont-know-how-to-help-them-residents-of-burnt-building-refuse-help-for-fear-of-deportation-20230901|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2024, a 29-year-old man was arrested after he confessed to starting the fire. The man said he started the fire in order to get rid of another murder victim's body on the orders of a Tanzanian drug dealer who also lived in the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-deadly-fire-inquiry-1586af852facb5d355ec8feb67d6c60e|title=South African police arrest man who says he started a fire that left 76 dead to hide another killing|last=Imray|first=Gerald|work=Associated Press|date=January 23, 2024}}</ref> He is currently facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68074917|title=Man held for murder over South Africa building fire|last=De Simone|first=Daniel|work=BBC News|date=January 23, 2024}}</ref>
