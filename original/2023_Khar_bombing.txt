The [[insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] began in 2004 and its volatility peaked in the late 2000s and early 2010s, including two [[suicide bombings]] in Khar in [[January 2010 Khar bombing|January]] and [[December 2010 Khar bombing|December]] of 2010. This [[civil war]] slowed to a [[low-intensity conflict]] in 2017. However, the region has seen an increase in [[terrorism in Pakistan|terrorist]] activity during the 2020s, with major protests erupting against the deteriorating security situation in January 2023.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hanifullah |title=Bajaur rises up against 'terror redux' |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2394513/bajaur-rises-up-against-terror-redux |access-date=31 July 2023 |work=The Express Tribune |date=6 January 2023 |archive-date=7 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230107084758/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2394513/bajaur-rises-up-against-terror-redux |url-status=live }}</ref>
