In 2022, Card's hearing began to deteriorate, which his family noticed was accompanied by a change in his demeanor, becoming sullen and short-tempered. By the spring of 2023, he started to believe that people at a local market and the bar where he enjoyed playing cornhole were gossiping about him and labeling him a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]. He also experienced significant weight loss.<ref name=ProfoundDamage/>

In May 2023, Card's son and ex-wife reported his declining mental health to a [[Sagadahoc County, Maine|Sagadahoc County]] sheriff's deputy, associating his reports of [[auditory hallucination]]s to being fitted for [[hearing aid]]s in February 2023.<ref name=":2" /> In July 2023, leaders of Card's unit (3rd Battalion, [[304th Infantry Regiment]]) made a report to law enforcement about Card's alarming comments and erratic behavior while training at [[Camp Smith (New York)|Camp Smith]] (close to the [[U.S. Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Sundby |first1=Alex |last2=Watson |first2=Eleanor |date=2023-10-31 |title=Army decided Maine shooting gunman Robert Card shouldn't have a weapon after erratic behavior in July |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maine-shooting-robert-card-police-check-army/ |access-date=2024-12-10 |website=CBS News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="Times-Union">{{Cite web |last1=Pantuso |first1=Phillip |last2=Solomon |first2=Joshua |date=2023-10-28 |title=State Police didn't pursue 'red flag' order for Maine shooting suspect |url=https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/maine-shooting-suspect-robert-card-wasn-t-18450627.php |access-date=2024-12-10 |website=Times Union |language=en}}</ref> The Army Reserve specifically told law enforcement that he threatened to "shoot up" a military base in [[Saco, Maine]]. He was removed from training exercises, and the [[New York State Police]] responded and transported Card to West Point's Keller Army Community Hospital for [[psychological evaluation]]. He received two weeks of additional treatment at the Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in [[Katonah, New York]].<ref name="BBC News" /><ref name="Times-Union" /> Doctors prescribed [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] but did not assess Card for a [[traumatic brain injury]], according to his sister.

Card returned home on August 3, 2023, and the Army barred him from handling guns or ammunition, deeming him a "non-deployable" serviceman.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Royzman |first1=Valerie |last2=Loftus |first2=Sawyer |date=2023-10-31 |title=Army barred Robert Card from handling guns 2 months before Lewiston mass shooting |url=http://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/10/31/news/army-prohibited-robert-card-handling-guns-before-lewiston-mass-shooting/ |access-date=2023-11-01 |website=Bangor Daily News |language=en-US |archive-date=November 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101115413/https://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/10/31/news/army-prohibited-robert-card-handling-guns-before-lewiston-mass-shooting/ |url-status=live }}</ref> That same day, a [[gun shop]] in [[Auburn, Maine]], denied his access to purchase a [[Silencer (firearms)|silencer]] because he responded "yes" to the question "Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR ever been committed to a mental institution?" on the ATF [[Form 4473]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Salahieh |first1=Nouran |last2=Prokupecz |first2=Shimon |last3=Britzky |first3=Haley |date=2023-10-31 |title=The Army said the Maine gunman 'should not have a weapon' months before the mass shootings that left 18 dead |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/us/maine-mass-shootings-warning-signs-tuesday/index.html |access-date=2024-12-10 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref><ref name="The Boston Globe">{{Cite news |last1=Ellement |first1=John R. |last2=McGrane |first2=Victoria |date=31 October 2023 |title=Newly Released Documents Detail Timeline Ahead of Lewiston, Maine, Shootings |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/31/metro/robert-card-timeline/ |access-date=1 November 2023}}</ref> In the subsequent months, Card had several angry and violent episodes. On one occasion, his mother found him crying on her front porch due to his [[delusion]]s of being talked about. He also left his job as a recycling truck driver.<ref name=ProfoundDamage/>

In mid-September 2023, the Army Reserve requested that the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Department conduct a well-being check on Card after he punched a fellow reservist who asked him to stop talking about "shooting up places and people". Card did not answer the door but could be heard moving inside his [[Trailer park|trailer home]] by the sheriff's deputy outside. Because Card was described by his commanders as a top marksman, the deputy requested backup from the [[Kennebec County, Maine|Kennebec County]] Sheriff's Department, about 45 minutes away, and wrote in a report that "due to being in a very disadvantageous position we decided to back away".<ref name="The Boston Globe" />

According to a police affidavit, Card's family members indicated Card believed he was being broadcast as a pedophile online by businesses and people including Just-In-Time, Schemengees, and a manager at Schemengees, who was one of the eight victims there that night.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ohm |first=Rachel |date=October 31, 2023 |title="Lewiston gunman met ex at Schemengees, believed businesses were calling him a pedophile, affidavit says" |work=Portland Press Herald |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2023/10/31/affidavit-lewiston-gunman-met-ex-at-schemengees-believed-businesses-were-calling-him-a-pedophile/}}</ref>

===Shooter's brain damage===
At the request of the Maine Chief Medical Examiner's office, a sample of Card's brain tissue was examined at [[Boston University]]'s [[Boston University CTE Center and Brain Bank|CTE Center]].<ref name="CLFoundation">{{Cite web |title=Family of Robert Card II releases findings of his brain tissue analysis in effort to prevent future tragedies |url=https://concussionfoundation.org/news/press-release/family-of-Robert-Card-II-releases-findings-of-his-brain-tissue-analysis-in-effort-to-prevent-future-tragedies |access-date=2024-12-10 |website=Concussion Legacy Foundation |language=en-usa}}</ref> The findings, released by Card's family, showed profound brain damage, including missing [[white matter]]; white matter with "moderately severe" damage; "disorganized clumps" of [[myelin]] (fatty sheaths surrounding [[axon]]s); damage to axons; and scarring and [[Neuroinflammation|inflammation throughout the brain]]. Although the tissue did not show evidence of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), it did confirm that Card had traumatic brain injury that resembled the brain damage in veterans exposed to [[explosion|blasts]].

Shortly after the shooting, there was an increase in the number of individuals within the state looking to purchase a weapon.

Card had used [[Twitter]] to like and retweet [[Far-right politics|far-right extremist]] views, including [[Transphobia|transphobic]] views by right-wing figures like [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Donald Trump Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Wiggins |first=Christopher |date=October 27, 2023 |title=Maine Massacre Suspect's Anti-Transgender, Extremist Views Emerge Amid Pleas For Gun Control |url=https://www.advocate.com/crime/maine-massacre-suspect-transphobic-posts |access-date=October 28, 2023 |website=[[The Advocate (magazine)|The Advocate]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Owen |first=Greg |date=2023-10-27 |title=Suspected Maine mass shooter made anti-trans posts on social media |url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/10/suspect-maine-mass-shooter-made-anti-trans-posts-on-social-media/ |access-date=2023-10-28 |website=LGBTQ Nation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wiggins |first=Christopher |date=26 October 2023 |title=Maine Mass Shooter Liked Anti-Trans Posts Online |url=https://www.advocate.com/crime/maine-massacre-suspect-transphobic-posts |access-date=2023-10-28 |website=The Advocate |language=en}}</ref>

=== Disinformation ===
According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', right after the shooting, social media platforms such as [[TikTok]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] were flooded with disinformation about Card. This included false claims that he had been arrested and was no longer at large. Some stated inaccurately, based on information about someone else with the same name, that Card was arrested in 2016 for possessing and disseminating sexually explicit materials.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gilbert |first=David |title=Maine Mass Shooting Disinformation Floods Social Media as Suspect Remains at Large |url=https://www.wired.com/story/maine-mass-shooting-disinformation/ |magazine=Wired |language=en-US |issn=1059-1028 |access-date=October 28, 2023 |archive-date=October 27, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231027235914/https://www.wired.com/story/maine-mass-shooting-disinformation/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Roscoe |first=Jules |date=October 26, 2023 |title='Verified' X Accounts Are Spreading Misinformation About Maine Shooter Still at Large |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjpy3/verified-x-accounts-are-spreading-misinformation-about-maine-shooter-still-at-large |access-date=October 28, 2023 |website=Vice |language=en |archive-date=October 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028054934/https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjpy3/verified-x-accounts-are-spreading-misinformation-about-maine-shooter-still-at-large |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Findings of independent commission ==
Maine Governor Janet Mills established an independent commission to investigate the shooting. The seven-member commission, chaired by [[Daniel Wathen]], reviewed thousands of pages of documents, gathered facts from many witnesses, and held public meetings. In August 2024, the commission issued a 215-page final report, announced at [[Lewiston City Hall (Lewiston, Maine)|Lewiston City Hall]]. The report concluded that both police and the Army Reserve missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy.<ref name="CBSRpt">[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lewiston-maine-mass-shootings-robert-card-army-police-could-have-intervened-final-report/ Army and police missed opportunities to potentially stop Maine mass shooter, report says], CBS News (August 20, 2024).</ref> The report found that Card's behavior provided sufficient evidence for the local sheriff's office to have obtained a "yellow flag" order to seize Card's guns in September 2023, yet failed to do so.<ref name="CBSRpt" /> The report also concluded that the Army Reserves failed to provide appropriate healthcare for Card or to remove his access to weapons, even after a reservist sent a text message to an Army supervisor, saying, "I believe he [Card]'s going to snap and do a mass shooting."<ref name="CBSRpt" />
