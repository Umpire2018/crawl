The Coast Guard claimed in official statements that the boat and its passengers had refused assistance because its destination was Italy, and so its boats had hung back.<ref name="Smith_Henley_20230615" />

In the afternoon, one of the merchant ships approached the ''Adriana'' and offered it assistance; the passengers refused it. Another merchant ship later did the same and received the same response. A HCG patrol approached the deck of the vessel in the evening, where they confirmed the presence of a large number of migrants.<ref name="Gatopoulos_Paphitis_20230617"/> The migrants again refused any aid, stating that they wished to continue to Italy.

==Capsizing==
At around 1:40&nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]) on 14 June, the HCG learned that the ''Adriana''{{'s}} engine had broken down.<ref name="Gatopoulos_Paphitis_20230617"/> After receiving a plea for aid, HCG officers then approached the ship.

* [[António Guterres]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]], stated on 14 June 2023, that “this is yet another example of the need for Member States to come together and create orderly safe pathways for people forced to flee and for comprehensive action to save lives at sea and reduce perilous journeys.”<ref name=":3" />
* [[Migrant Workers Convention|UN Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW)]], released a statement on 21 June 2023, calling on the European Union, the African Union and the League of Arab States to work together to establish safe and regular migration routes after at least 81 migrants drowned and hundreds more went missing in one of Europe’s deadliest shipwreck.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-21 |title=Greece shipwreck: UN committee dismayed by rising death toll, calls for international cooperation to prioritize safe migration pathways |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2023/06/greece-shipwreck-un-committee-dismayed-rising-death-toll-calls-international |website=OHCHR}}</ref>
* [[Dunja Mijatović]], Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, sent a letter on 19th of July 2023 to the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis stressing that Greece has a legal obligation to conduct effective investigations into the Pylos shipwreck, which resulted in the death of more than 80 persons with many hundreds still missing, to establish the facts and, where appropriate, to lead to the punishment of those responsible. The Commissioner expresses concern about reports of pressure having been exercised on survivors and about allegations of irregularities in the collection of evidence and testimonies, which may have led to a minimisation of the focus on certain actors in this tragedy, including the Greek Coast Guard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pylos shipwreck investigation: Human Rights Commissioner addresses letter to Greek Prime Minister - Portal - www.coe.int |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/pylos-shipwreck-investigation-human-rights-commissioner-addresses-letter-to-greek-prime-minister |access-date=2024-02-05 |website=Portal |language=en-GB}}</ref>
