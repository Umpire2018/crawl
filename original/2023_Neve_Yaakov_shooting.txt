== Attack ==
According to [[Haaretz]], the attacker first walked 200 metres past the Neve Yaakov synagogue and killed four passersby and a motorcyclist. People who had heard the shots began to emerge from the synagogue and the attacker fired at them and then, on the way back to his car, killed two more people at an [[intersection (road)|intersection]].<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Peleg |first1=Bar |last2=Breiner |first2=Josh |last3=Hasson |first3=Nir |date=28 January 2023 |title=Six Minutes of Terror: How the Deadliest Attack in Israel in Recent Years Unfolded |newspaper=Haaretz |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-01-28/ty-article-magazine/.premium/six-minutes-of-terror-how-the-deadliest-attack-in-israel-in-recent-years-unfolded/00000185-f976-d4a2-adb5-f97e40e00000 |url-status=live |access-date=29 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202131151/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-01-28/ty-article-magazine/.premium/six-minutes-of-terror-how-the-deadliest-attack-in-israel-in-recent-years-unfolded/00000185-f976-d4a2-adb5-f97e40e00000 |archive-date=2 February 2023}}</ref>

==Background==
The shooting took place on [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]], which some commentators suggested could be connected to the attack. On the other hand, there is just as much to suggest that it was an act of revenge driven by biographical motives.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meier |first=Christian |place=Tel Aviv |title=Tote in Israel: Zwei Angriffe kurz nacheinander in Ostjerusalem |trans-title=Deaths in Israel: Two attacks in East Jerusalem in quick succession |language=de |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/zwei-angriffe-kurz-nacheinander-in-ostjerusalem-18637003.html |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date=2023-01-28 |access-date=2023-02-10 |quote=Manche Kommentatoren wiesen darauf hin, dass die Tat am Internationalen Holocaust-Gedenktag stattfand.

===Location===
[[Neve Yaakov]], the location where the attack took place, is an [[Israeli settlement]] in [[East Jerusalem]] established in 1972 on land expropriated from three neighboring Palestinian towns; it forms part of a [[Ring Settlements, East Jerusalem|belt of settlements]] interspersed among the area's Palestinian neighborhoods. Writing in [[Mondoweiss]], Jalal Abukhater argues that Neve Yaakov "in its entirety is built on private and titled lands, whose Palestinian owners were never consulted or compensated before the hostile takeover", in addition to being home of the [[Israeli Defence Force]]'s [[Central Command (Israel)|Central Command]] over the West Bank, and the "attack cannot be separated from this context."<ref name=Mondo>{{cite news |url=https://mondoweiss.net/2023/02/contextualizing-the-shooting-in-neve-yaakov/ |title=Contextualizing the shooting in Neve Yaakov |work=[[Mondoweiss]] |first=Jalal |last=Abukhater |date=2 February 2023 |access-date=6 February 2023 |archive-date=6 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206013923/https://mondoweiss.net/2023/02/contextualizing-the-shooting-in-neve-yaakov/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
