General elections were held in [[Nigeria]] on 25 February 2023 to elect the [[President of Nigeria|president]] and [[Vice President of Nigeria|vice president]] and members of the [[2023 Nigerian Senate election|Senate]] and [[2023 Nigerian House of Representatives election|House of Representatives]]. Incumbent president [[Muhammadu Buhari]] was term-limited and could not seek re-election for a third term.<ref name="New Dates">{{cite web |last1=Jimoh |first1=Abbas |title=INEC Sets New Dates For 2023 General Elections |url=https://dailytrust.com/just-in-inec-sets-new-dates-for-2023-general-elections |website=[[Daily Trust]] |access-date=26 February 2022 |date=26 February 2022}}</ref> This election was seen as the tightest race since the end of military rule in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nigeria election 2023: Early results arriving |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64772763 |date=26 February 2023 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The [[President of Nigeria]] is elected using a modified [[two-round system]] with up to three rounds. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive a plurality of the votes and over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]] and the [[Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)|Federal Capital Territory]]. If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a majority of votes in the highest number of states. In the second round, a candidate still must receive the most votes and over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]] and the [[Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)|Federal Capital Territory]] to be elected. If neither candidate passes this threshold, a third round will be held where just majority of the votes is required to be elected.

The 109 members of the [[Senate (Nigeria)|Senate]] are elected from 109 single-seat constituencies (three in each state and one for the [[Federal Capital Territory]]) by first-past-the-post voting.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-02-16|title=National Assembly {{!}} Federal Republic of Nigeria|url=https://nass.gov.ng/page/about-the-senate|access-date=2020-12-18|website=National Assembly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216064208/https://nass.gov.ng/page/about-the-senate|archive-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> The 360 members of the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|House of Representatives]] are also elected by [[first-past-the-post voting]] in single-member constituencies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=IPU PARLINE database: NIGERIA (House of Representatives), Electoral system|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2363_B.htm|access-date=2020-12-18|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>
