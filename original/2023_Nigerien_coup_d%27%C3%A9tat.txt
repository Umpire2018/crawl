== Background ==
{{further|2021 Nigerien coup d'état attempt}}
Niger had previously undergone four military coups since [[History of Niger#Independence|independence from France]] in 1960, with the most recent having occurred in [[2010 Nigerien coup d'état|2010]]. In between, there were also several coup attempts, the most recent of which was in [[2021 Nigerien coup d'état attempt|2021]] when military dissidents tried to seize the presidential palace two days before the inauguration of president-elect [[Mohamed Bazoum]].{{efn|group=L|In March 2023, a Nigerien official alleged that another coup attempt was made while Bazoum was in [[Turkey]], although the government refused to comment.<ref name="f24"/>}} He was the country's first democratically elected president to assume office from a similarly elected predecessor. The coup also came in the wake of recent coups in nearby countries, such as in [[2021 Guinean coup d'état|Guinea]], [[2021 Malian coup d'état|Mali]], and [[2021 Sudan coup d'état|Sudan]] in 2021, and two in [[Burkina Faso]] in [[January 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|January]] and [[September 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état|September]] 2022, which has led to the region being called a "[[coup belt]]".<ref name="aj1">{{Cite web |date=26 July 2023 |title=Niger's Bazoum 'held by guards' in apparent coup attempt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/26/soldiers-holding-niger-president-inside-palace-security-sources |access-date=27 July 2023 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en-US |archive-date=27 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727002123/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/26/soldiers-holding-niger-president-inside-palace-security-sources |url-status=live }}</ref>

Niger is a member of [[ECOWAS]], which has already suspended [[Guinea]], [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] from membership due to successful coups in recent years. [[Bola Tinubu]], President of [[Nigeria]], was appointed Chairman of ECOWAS on 9 July 2023 and warned that they will not allow another coup in the region and would take up these issues with the [[African Union]] and Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Okafor |first=Chiamaka |date=10 July 2023 |title=We will not tolerate coups in West Africa – Tinubu |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/608962-we-will-not-tolerate-coups-in-west-africa-tinubu.html |access-date=30 July 2023 |website=Premium Times Nigeria |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Analysts cite the rising cost of living and perceptions of government "incompetence", as well as Bazoum's plans to replace the head of the presidential guard, General Abdourahmane Tchiani as possible triggers for the coup.<ref name="aj1"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=The coup in Niger |url=https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/2023/the-coup-in-niger/ |access-date=2023-08-21 |website=IISS |language=en}}</ref>

In 2022, the country became the hub of France's anti-jihadist operations in the [[Sahel]] region following its expulsion from [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]], with Bazoum being described as one of the few remaining pro-Western leaders in the region.<ref name="f24" /> Niger became a key ally for Western, particularly French, American, and Turkish forces.

At the same time, along with [[anti-French sentiment]], a current of thought favorable to the entry of Russian influence and the [[Wagner Group]] mercenary company began to grow. Russia, through Wagner, has been gaining ground at the expense of the French in the region, following the latest coups in Mali and Burkina Faso. At the same time, Turkey has also expanded its influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/03/16/Mali-s-junta-gets-warplanes-drones-from-Russia-Turkey|title=Mali's junta gets warplanes, drones from Russia, Turkey|work=al-Arabiya |date=16 March 2023 }}</ref>

The leadership of the Niger Armed Forces issued a statement signed by the army chief of staff, General [[Abdou Sidikou Issa]], declaring its support for the coup.

===28 July===
General [[Abdourahamane Tchiani]] proclaimed himself as the president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland in an address on Télé Sahel. He said the coup was undertaken to avoid "the gradual and inevitable demise" of the country and said that Bazoum had tried to hide "the harsh reality" of the country, which he called "a pile of dead, displaced, humiliation and frustration". He also criticized the government's security strategy for its purported ineffectiveness and lack of collaboration with Mali and Burkina Faso but did not give a timeline for a return to civilian rule. His position as ''de facto'' concurrent head of state was later confirmed by Colonel Abdramane, who accused officials of Bazoum's government of plotting against the new regime while sheltering in foreign embassies and warned of bloodshed if they pushed through.<ref name="f24tchiani">{{Cite web |work=France 24 |title=Niger's General Abdourahamane Tchiani declares himself leader after coup |date=28 July 2023 |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230728-niger-s-general-abdourahamane-tchiani-declared-new-leader-following-coup-state-tv |access-date=9 August 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Niger coup: Abdourahmane Tchiani declares himself leader |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66337767 |date=28 July 2023 |work=BBC |access-date=28 July 2023}}</ref><ref name="ajtchiani">{{cite news |title=Niger general Tchiani named head of transitional government after coup |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/28/niger-general-tchiani-named-head-of-transitional-government-after-coup |date=28 July 2023 |work=Al Jazeera |access-date=28 July 2023}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Nigerien crisis (2023–present)}}

Disruption within Niger following the coup has continued, with demonstrations, censorship of broadcasts and interruptions to power supplies, as well as evacuations of foreign nationals. The situation eventually escalated into a serious international crisis that has led to threats of military intervention by ECOWAS and heightened tensions and military mobilization in Niger.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-26 |title=African Union, ECOWAS condemn 'attempted coup d'état' in Niger |url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20230726-african-union-ecowas-condemn-attempted-coup-in-niger |access-date=2023-11-27 |website=France 24 |language=en}}</ref>

On 10 August, the junta declared a new government, naming 21 ministers led by Prime Minister [[Ali Lamine Zeine]] in an announcement on [[Télé Sahel]] by "secretary-general of the government" Mahamane Roufai Laouali. Three Generals who were members of the CNSP were named to head the Interior, Defense and Sports ministries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Niger military names 21-person cabinet ahead of key West African summit |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/10/niger-military-names-21-person-cabinet-ahead-of-west-african-summit |access-date=10 August 2023 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

The heavy pressure from the international community and ECOWAS to hand over power, has prompted the junta to seek support from like-minded regimes in the region.

On 13 August, the junta announced that it would prosecute Bazoum for "high treason" and "undermining the country's security".<ref>{{cite news |title=Niger military regime says will 'prosecute' president Bazoum for 'high treason' |url=https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/08/14/Niger-military-regime-says-will-prosecute-president-Bazoum-for-high-treason- |access-date=14 August 2023 |work=al-Arabiya|date=13 August 2023}}</ref>

On 24 September, French President Emmanuel Macron announced [[France]] was [[French military withdrawal from West Africa (2022–present)|pulling its troops]] as well as diplomatic staff, including its ambassador [[Sylvain Itté]], from Niger by the end of 2023. Prior to this, Itté had defied the junta's demand for his expulsion, which led to a total blockade of the French embassy in Niamey.<ref>{{Cite web |title=France to withdraw ambassador, troops from Niger after coup: Macron |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/24/france-to-withdraw-ambassador-troops-from-niger-after-coup-macron |access-date=2023-09-24 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Analysis==
Cameron Hudson, a senior associate of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], said that the coup could impact Niger's fight against the Islamist insurgency, adding that there were indications that the Nigerien military was not pleased with the level of support they received to fight militants.<ref name="cnn1"/> Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], said the coup was a "nightmare" for the West, which counted on Bazoum and Niger as its "new security anchor" in the region.<ref name="ap1"/> Flavien Baumgartner, an Africa analyst at the security and political risk consultancy Dragonfly, said that Bazoum's removal could lead to the Wagner Group expanding into Niger, given that the country is an important producer of [[uranium]].<ref name="ap2" />

At the time of the coup, a major oil pipeline that would be the longest in Africa at 1,980 kilometers in length was under construction. It would connect the oil fields of the [[Agadem]] oasis, in the [[Erg of Bilma]], in [[Diffa Region|Diffa]], Niger with the [[Port Seme]] Terminal in [[Benin]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/niger-benin-crude-pipeline/# |title=Niger-Benin Crude Pipeline |work=www.nsenergybusiness.com |access-date=5 August 2023}}</ref> By October 2022, 30% of the pipeline was complete.<ref>{{Cite web |last=theafricalogistics |date=19 October 2022 |title=Africa's longest oil pipeline 30% complete |url=https://theafricalogistics.com/2022/10/19/africas-longest-oil-pipeline-30-complete-2/ |access-date=4 August 2023 |website=The Africa Logistics |language=en-US}}</ref> Benin authorities commented that the sanctions imposed on Niger by ECOWAS after the coup, although they did not stop construction work, could mean a significant delay.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Benin says Niger oil pipeline not impacted by regional sanctions over coup |date=3 August 2023 |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/3/benin-says-niger-oil-pipeline-not-impacted-by-regional-sanctions-over-coup |access-date=9 August 2023 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref> The [[Trans-Saharan gas pipeline]] connecting Europe and Nigeria was still being planned at the time of the coup.

The coup is seen by the [[International Crisis Group]] as encouraging for jihadists, as the coups in Mali and Burkina Faso were followed by intensified jihadist violence, according to [[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project|ACLED]] data.<ref name="Niger coup leaders blamed insecurity"/>
