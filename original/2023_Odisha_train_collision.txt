On 2 June 2023, three [[train collision|trains collided]] in [[Balasore district]] in the [[east India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. The accident occurred around 19:00 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] when [[Coromandel Express]], a passenger train, collided with a stationary [[freight train|goods train]] near [[Bahanaga Bazar railway station]] on the [[Howrah–Chennai main line]]. Due to the high speed of the passenger train and the heavy tonnage of the goods train, the impact resulted in 21 coaches of the Coromandel Express [[derailment|derailing]] and three of those collided with the oncoming [[SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Superfast Express]] on the adjacent track.

296 people were killed in the crash and more than 1,200 were injured. It was one of the [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Rail|deadliest]] railway accidents [[List of railway accidents and incidents in India|in India]]. [[National Disaster Response Force]] (NDRF) and [[Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force]] (ODRAF) were involved in the search and recovery efforts, assisted by other government agencies and the general public. The injured were treated at local hospitals in the region. In the aftermath, operations of more than 150 trains were impacted, with the cancellation of at least 48 trains. The rail services resumed on the line on 5 June after restoration work.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the Coromandel Express entered a [[passing loop]] line instead of the main line at full speed and crashed into the stationary goods train. In the aftermath, [[Minister of Railways (India)|Railway Minister]] stated that a change in [[Interlocking#Electronic interlocking|electronic interlocking]] due to an error in electronic signalling, caused the crash. He also said that sabotage was suspected and the [[Indian Railway Board|railway board]] had recommended a [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI)-led probe. On 7 July 2023, the CBI arrested three railway officials believed to be responsible for the accident.

Despite the statement of the railway authorities that the accident was not a reflection of the safety issues in the system, various questions were raised by journalists, politicians and retired railway employees. The railway lines were not equipped with the [[Kavach (train protection system)|Kavach train protection system]]. It was made aware that a similar signalling error had been reported earlier in February 2023 and a December 2022 report by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] had warned that the safety department of the railways lacked adequate staffing and funding, suffered from misuse of funds and that these could impact the quality of maintenance.

== Crash ==
On 2 June 2023, the [[Coromandel Express]] (Train no:12841) was travelling from [[Shalimar railway station|Shalimar]] in [[Howrah, West Bengal]], to [[Chennai Central railway station|Chennai Central]] in [[Chennai, Tamil Nadu]] on the [[Rail directions#Up and down|up line]] of the [[Howrah-Chennai main line]] near [[Bahanaga Bazar railway station]]. At the same time, the [[Howrah–SMVT Bengaluru Superfast Express|SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Express]] (Train no:12864) was travelling in the opposite direction from [[Sir M. Visvesvaraya Terminal]] in [[Bengaluru, Karnataka]], to [[Howrah railway station|Howrah]] on the adjacent down line. Both trains were not scheduled to stop at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station and received a green signal to proceed along the main line. The trains were travelling fast, close to the maximum permitted speed of {{cvt|128|kph}}.<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news |date=4 June 2023 |title=India train disaster: Signal fault the likely cause, minister says |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65801807 |url-status=live |access-date=4 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604144919/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65801807 |archive-date=4 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=3 June 2023 |title=Balasore: How did three trains collide in Odisha? |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65796173 |access-date=6 June 2023 |archive-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230603182629/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65796173 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Crash">{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odisha-three-train-accident-288-dead-in-indias-worst-train-tragedy-since-1995/articleshow/100733374.cms |title=Odisha three-train accident: 288 dead in India's worst train tragedy since 1995; survivors recount horrors |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 June 2023 |access-date=14 June 2024 |archive-date=14 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240614235802/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odisha-three-train-accident-288-dead-in-indias-worst-train-tragedy-since-1995/articleshow/100733374.cms |url-status=live }}</ref>

A preliminary investigation conducted by officials of the [[Kharagpur railway division]] indicated that the following sequence of events occurred:<ref>{{cite news |date=3 June 2023 |title=Odisha tragedy: How the 3 trains collided into each other |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-tragedy-how-the-3-trains-collided-into-each-other/articleshow/100727427.cms?from=mdr |access-date=3 June 2023 |issn=0971-8257 |archive-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603170614/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-tragedy-how-the-3-trains-collided-into-each-other/articleshow/100727427.cms?from=mdr |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=3 June 2023 |title=Odisha tragedy: Preliminary enquiry indicates signalling failure caused train accident |url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/odisha-tragedy-preliminary-enquiry-indicates-signalling-failure-caused-train-accident-12686602.html |access-date=3 June 2023 |work=Firstpost |archive-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603170909/https://www.firstpost.com/india/odisha-tragedy-preliminary-enquiry-indicates-signalling-failure-caused-train-accident-12686602.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

* The Coromandel Express was heading towards Chennai on a southbound up line at speeds close to {{cvt|128|kph}} and was given the green signal to proceed on the main line. However, the signal was modified to take the train off the main line for unknown reasons, and the track was switched to a loop line adjacent to the main line.
* The Coromandel Express then hit the rear end of a stationary goods train, which was on the south loop line. This caused the locomotive of the Coromandel Express to climb over the wagons of the goods train and caused the derailment of 22 of its coaches.
* In the meantime, the [[Howrah–SMVT Bengaluru Superfast Express|SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Express]], which was heading towards Howrah on the northbound down line at a speed of approximately {{cvt|126|kph}}, was passing the Coromandel Express in the opposite direction. At the moment of the crash, most of the coaches of the SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Express, had passed the other train except for the rear end.
* When the Coromandel Express derailed, three of its coaches hit the last two coaches (along with the brake van) of the SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Express; consequently, those five coaches saw most of the casualties.
