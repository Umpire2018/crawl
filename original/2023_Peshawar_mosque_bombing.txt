{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}

On 30 January 2023, at around 1:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Pakistan Standard Time]] ([[UTC+05:00|UTC+5]]), a [[suicide bomber]] set off an explosion within the Police Lines [[mosque]] of [[Peshawar]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]], killing 84 people and injuring 217. The mosque, located within a high-security compound containing several government offices, including the headquarters of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police]], was infiltrated by the perpetrator after he had disguised himself as a police officer, allowing him to pass through several security checkpoints and join the congregational [[Zuhr prayer|Zuhr]] prayers. The bombing destroyed a wall and the roof of the mosque, burying hundreds of people in rubble.

[[Jamaat-ul-Ahrar]], a faction of the [[Pakistani Taliban]] (TTP), claimed responsibility for the bombing, stating that it was carried out to avenge the death of their founder and former leader [[Omar Khalid Khorasani]]. Shortly after their claim, the TTP issued a statement denying any involvement, though the Pakistani government and other commentators maintain that the group likely knew of and approved the attack. The bombing was widely condemned domestically and internationally, with leaders from around the world expressing condolences to the victims and their families. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General's]] spokeswoman called the bombing "particularly abhorrent" as it took place in a site of worship.

== Background ==
{{Main|Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}
Formed in 2007, the Pakistani Taliban has waged an ongoing insurgency against the Pakistani government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province with the goal of ousting the state and enforcing their own interpretation of [[Sharia|Sharia law]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite news |last1=Baloch |first1=Shah Meer |last2=Ellis-Petersen |first2=Hannah |date=2023-01-31 |title=North-west Pakistan in grip of deadly Taliban resurgence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/terrorists-north-west-pakistan-deadly-taliban-resurgence |access-date=2024-11-13 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> After waging deadly attacks across the nation during the late 2000s and early 2010s, the TTP's power would significantly diminish after several military offensives conducted against them [[Operation Zarb-e-Azb|in 2014]] and [[Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad|2017]], forcing the group to mostly retreat into neighbouring [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Riaz |last2=Ahmed |first2=Munir |date=2023-02-01 |title=Peshawar, the city of flowers, becomes epicenter of violence |url=https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-bombing-peshawar-center-of-violence-114a31bb53b3ebe1c9177174965fa91c |access-date=2024-11-13 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref> After being driven out, the TTP under the leadership of [[Noor Wali Mehsud]] underwent several policy changes and mergers with other militant groups that would allow the organization to rebuild their strength.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sayed |first=Abdul |date=2021-12-21 |title=The Evolution and Future of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan |url=https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/12/the-evolution-and-future-of-tehrik-e-taliban-pakistan?lang=en |access-date=2024-11-13 |website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Ahmed |first=Samina |date=2023-03-29 |title=The Pakistani Taliban Test Ties between Islamabad and Kabul |url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/pakistan/pakistani-taliban-test-ties-between-islamabad-and-kabul |access-date=2024-11-13 |website=International Crisis Group}}</ref> Among these mergers included the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar in 2020, a previous faction of the TTP which split from them in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=2020-08-17 |title=Pakistani Taliban splinter factions officially rejoin group |url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/08/pakistani-taliban-splinter-factions-officially-rejoin-group.php |access-date=2024-11-13 |website=FDD's Long War Journal |language=en-US}}</ref> After [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|the Afghan Taliban took over Kabul]] in August 2021, the Pakistani government initially expected that the new [[Taliban|Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] would crack down on TTP safe havens within the country.

Peshawar, the largest city and capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has been the scene of various attacks from the TTP and other militants throughout the years. This includes the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre]], in which nearly 150 people, mostly children, were killed by the TTP as well as [[2022 Peshawar mosque attack|a bombing at a Shia mosque]] in 2022, which was conducted by the [[Islamic State – Khorasan Province|Islamic State - Khorasan Province]].<ref name=":8" />

==Bombing==
On 30 January 2023, the perpetrator, an Afghan national identified as "Qari", was picked up by his driver on a motorcycle at [[Charsadda]] Mosque and taken to the Rahman Baba Graveyard in Peshawar, where he put on a police uniform and a concealed explosive vest.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Husain |first=Fahhd |date=2024-11-13 |title=Macabre confessions of a terror facilitator

=== Analysis ===
The TTP is an umbrella organization comprising a plethora of different factions, including Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.<ref name=":0" /> American terrorism commentator [[Bill Roggio]] suggested that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar may have launched the attack without the knowledge or approval of TTP leadership.<ref name="LWJ 20232">{{cite web |last1=Roggio |first1=Bill |date=30 January 2023 |title=Pakistani Taliban kills scores in mosque bombing in Peshawar |url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2023/01/pakistani-taliban-kills-scores-in-mosque-bombing-in-peshawar.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202025049/https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2023/01/pakistani-taliban-kills-scores-in-mosque-bombing-in-peshawar.php |archive-date=2 February 2023 |access-date=1 February 2023 |website=[[FDD's Long War Journal]]}}</ref> However, he states that the more likely situation was that the TTP was aware of the bombing and denies responsibility regardless, possibly relying on the fact that the groups relationships between their central leaders and various factions are complex and often confusing, giving them a level of [[plausible deniability]].<ref name="LWJ 20232" /> The [[International Crisis Group]] maintains that the TTP likely knew of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar's plans for the bombing, but subsequently backtracked on claiming it in fear of negative backlash towards the Taliban government in Afghanistan, who are housing TTP safehavens.<ref name=":0" />
