At the time of the shooting, the perpetrator was one in a pool of about 4,000 suspects in a double murder case that took place six days earlier, {{convert|25|km}} away, when a father and his infant daughter were murdered in [[Klánovice]].

Kozák fled on foot towards [[Úvaly]], leaving the forest first by bus, and then switching to a train once he reached Klánovice railway station.<ref name=":1" /> At some point during his escape, he passed by a couple with a stroller and considered shooting them as well, but decided not to after hearing sirens in the distance.<ref name=":1" />

The police conducted a detailed search of the entire forest with hundreds of officers, while a special task force was set up in order to find the perpetrator. The police had no direct leads.

===Charles University shooting===
[[File:Faculté arts Université Charles Prague 1.jpg|thumb|left|The main Faculty of Arts building]]

At around 14:54 CET, Kozák exited the restroom and opened fire inside the building's fourth floor corridors and classrooms.<ref name="officer" /> He repeatedly entered classroom No. 423, targeting everyone inside. Once he moved further away from this classroom, one of the students led remaining survivors to barricade the door. All of the people in this classroom were either killed or suffered life-threatening injuries.<ref name="Heroine" /> Kozák also entered classroom no. 417 on the same floor and fired upon those present.

A third-year history student named Tomáš Hercík has been credited with saving lives of several people during the shooting. At 14:59, one of the students present at a lecture taking place on the second floor received a message about the ongoing killing spree, prompting Hercík to head to the fourth floor. While passing by the third floor, he noticed people mingling in the corridors, seemingly unaware of the ongoing attack. Upon reaching the fourth floor, he immediately heard gunshots and people's cries. While avoiding the gunman, Hercík entered numerous classrooms and warned the people inside about the ongoing attack, making sure that they lock the doors, switch off lights, and remain quiet. He then retreated to the third floor, where he continued warning attendees in the classrooms.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Boubinová |first=Markéta |date=30 January 2024 |title="Věděl jsem, že mi jde o život."

==Investigation==
===Department of Internal Investigation===
On 9 January 2024, the police's Department of Internal Investigation presented the conclusion of its inquiry into police conduct in the case. The Department's director Michal Tikovský stated that they had found no mistakes in the police's handling of the case. He added that "The officers' actions were in accordance with the applicable legislation and internal regulations. The police intervention can be assessed as prompt and professional." Tikovský said that the police could not have known that the perpetrator was heading towards the main building, nor that he was preparing to carry out a mass murder. Applicable rules had also been followed when issuing the perpetrator's gun license.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/2460992 |title=Policie při zásahu na fakultě podle kontroly nechybovala, zlepšit má komunikaci |date=9 January 2024 |access-date=9 July 2024 |website=ČeskéNoviny.cz|publisher=[[Czech News Agency]]|language=cs}}</ref>

The Parliamentary Security Committee requested the Department's closing report. On 6 February 2024, they received a fifty-page report, in which 33 pages were completely redacted and the remaining 17 pages were mostly redacted. On page 39, it was stated that "it cannot be concluded that the police knew that the lives of the students of the Faculty of Philosophy in the building on Jana Palach Square were in real and immediate danger."

While the [[Police of the Czech Republic|police]] intervention after the attack had started was generally accepted as correct, a strong criticism was aimed at apparent mistakes in its search for Kozák before the University attack. In January 2024, the Chief of Prague Police Petr Matějček was defending the police procedure with explanation: "''We were still working with the idea that the man was a danger to himself and was going to commit suicide.''"<ref name="police knew" /> Interior Minister [[Vít Rakušan]] also commented that authorities had no indication of anyone else at risk other than Kozák himself,<ref name="bbctrail"/> and that police knew that the father was murdered only after decommissioning the improvised explosive device, which took place after the University attack was over.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://echo24.cz/a/Hbi5P/zopoeravy-domov-vedeli-hledaji-vrah-zaznam-policie-strelba-fakulta-rakusan |title=Věděli, že hledají vraha, ukazuje záznam policie o fakultě.

However, that was in contradiction with the information provided by the ''K.C.'' in the initial phone call and the murder scene within the house.<ref name="police knew" /> According to Lidové noviny, the circumstances of the father's death were clearly pointing to murder, police also had information about Kozák's firearms possession, and Matějček personally ordered a tactical unit to be present in the [[Staroměstské náměstí]] area before the attack commenced.<ref name="police knew" /> Moreover, on 26 June 2024, online daily ''Seznam zprávy'' published action reports filed by the policemen that had unsuccessfully searched for the perpetrator in the School of Arts main building. Three policemen signed under first report wrote that they were searching for Kozák "''suspected of murdering his father''". Report of the other unit explicitly stated: "''He was suspected of murdering his father while threatening suicide. Other information suggests that he is a mentally disturbed man who also possesses several weapons.''"<ref name="pol report">{{Cite news |last1=Ciroková |first1=Kristina|last2=Valášek |first2=Lukáš|date=2024-06-12 |title=Policie věděla, že na fakultě hledá vraha.

During 24 June 2024, Parliamentary Security Committee hearing, Matějček further alleged that it was technically impossible for the police officers who entered the building at 13:30 to review the security camera footage at that time. The footage later revealed the perpetrator's entry at 13:23. University official labeled Matějček's statement as a "lie", claiming that reviewing of previous footage can be done immediately, but the police officers asked for it only hours after the attack.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Janouš |first=Václav |date=22 June 2024 |title=Policie lže.

His father was generally considered to be a very gentle, kind and helpful person, while his mother had been the authoritative figure in the family.<ref name="bizarre" /> According to the psychologist, the family did not provide effective emotional support for the perpetrator.

Kozák also described being punished for failing to do household chores. He further described having little sleep, eating little and drinking only green tea.

Kozák's friend, who has been named only as ''K.C.''<ref name="5 questions" /> by the media, became worried about his mental state in the summer of 2022.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> Due to her intervention, Kozák underwent four visits with a psychiatrist between September and November 2022.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> Here, Kozák first disclosed suicidal thoughts, but during the visits, he progressed towards murderous ideas aimed at his parents as well as other unassuming people.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> The psychiatrist advised that Kozák start visiting a psychologist, which he did only once in December 2022.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

Psychiatrists in the Czech Republic have a legal duty to send their medical reports to the patient's general practitioner, "if the practitioner is known to them". As Kozák did not disclose the name of his general practitioner, no report was sent.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> ''[[Lidové noviny]]'', however, cited several psychiatrists, according to whom it was easy to find information about a patient's general practitioner. They claimed that it took "only three clicks" through an online communication channel with the patient's insurance provider. The {{Interlanguage link|Czech Medical Association|cs|Česká lékařská komora}} confirmed that a psychiatrist may learn about the general practitioner through this method; however there is no legal requirement to do so.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janouš|first1=Václav|last2=Kolář|first2=Petr|title=Zbrojní průkaz vraha z fakulty mohla psychiatrička zastavit.

The general practitioner could have learned about Kozák's psychiatric visits from an online database of the patient's medical prescriptions. However, reviewing this information is not obligatory, and the general practitioner that issued the bill of health failed to do so. The only information in the bill of health for the gun license was that Kozák had to wear glasses when using firearms.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

According to a police-ordered post-mortem psychological evaluation, Kozák had a personality that was "schizoid with narcissistic and dissociative traits and a very solid IQ", but did not suffer from any particular mental disorder.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

In September 2024, the vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Defense Committee [[Pavel Růžička]], together with the Minister of Defense [[Jana Černochová]] and other deputies, lodged a proposal to amend the Firearms Act to remedy the errors in the process of health clearance which were uncovered during the investigation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gawron|first1=Tomáš|title=Pozměňovací návrh řešící mezery posuzování zdravotní způsobilosti žadatelů o zbrojní průkaz v reakci na útok na FFUK|url=https://zbrojnice.com/2024/09/19/pozmenovaci-navrh-resici-mezery-posuzovani-zdravotni-zpusobilosti-zadatelu-o-zbrojni-prukaz-v-reakci-na-utok-na-ffuk/|website=zbrojnice.com|date=19 September 2024|access-date=3 October 2024|language=cs}}</ref>

===Planning of the attack===
Police concluded that Kozák had been planning to conduct a mass murder for a long time.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> He researched information about murderers, including the [[Viktor Kalivoda|Forest Killer]], the [[Jiří Straka|Spartakiad Killer]] and [[Anders Behring Breivik]].<ref name="Heroine">{{Cite news|last=Shabu|first=Martin|url=https://www.lidovky.cz/domov/filozoficka-fakulta-strelba-tragedie-odvazna-studentka-zachrana-spoluzaci-pribeh.A240617_192759_ln_domov_lsva|title=Neznámý příběh z tragédie na fakultě: zraněná studentka vedla obranu proti střelci, zachránila životy spolužáků|language=cs|date=17 July 2024|website=[[Lidové noviny]]|publisher=[[Mafra (company)|Mafra]]}}</ref> 

From the beginning of 2023, Kozák gradually started to identify with Keiji Kiriya, a character in ''[[All You Need Is Kill]]'', a Japanese science fiction novel which had previously been the topic of an essay he wrote in high school.<ref name="idnes 03-10-2024" /> In September 2023, he limited his planning to the University and its vicinity.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> He researched teaching schedules of the fourth floor classrooms and downloaded floorplans, both of the building he attacked as well as the other school building at the Celetná street.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> He made notes of the probable number of students in each of the classrooms.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> He was further researching public events at the nearby [[Rudolfinum]] building, Jan Palach square and other locations at the Prague Old Town.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

Kozák received a gift of CZK 300,000 (approximately USD 13,000) from his grandmother and liquidated CZK 400,000 (USD 17,000) from a long-term savings account. This money, as well as income from his airport job, was used towards the purchase of firearms and ammunition.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

Kozák had told several friends about his gun purchases.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> He shared most information with his friend ''K.C.'', whom he also informed about taking shooting courses.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> On 3 November 2023, the perpetrator told ''K.C.'' that he started exercising as he would have to carry heavy bags in a month or two.<ref name="idnes-final-report" /> On 6 December 2023, Kozák wrote messages to ''K.C.'', which in hindsight, according to the investigators, showed clear determination to commit a murder.<ref name="idnes-final-report" />

==Copycat incidents==
In November 2024, an unidentified minor female student from [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]] was sentenced to two years imprisonment for planning to murder three other students and for expressing approval of the Prague attack. The student had first tried to gain access to firearms owned by her friends' family members, and after failing to do so, she opted to commit the attack with a kitchen knife. She was arrested on 1 January 2024, a day before she planned to commit the murders. Additionally, the court decided that after serving her prison term, the girl will be involuntarily committed into a mental institution. Her release would be conditional upon a new court decision, subject to an expert opinion that she no longer poses a threat to society.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Břoušková|first1=Anna|title=Plánovala ubodat tři spolužačky, do vraždy chyběl den.
