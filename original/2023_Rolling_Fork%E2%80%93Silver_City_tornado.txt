On March 22, the [[National Weather Service]]'s [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) issued a level 3/enhanced risk of severe weather across portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi for [[supercell]] thunderstorms capable of large hail, damaging winds, and strong tornadoes (EF2+ on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]]).<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Mosier |date=March 24, 2023 |title=Mar 23, 2023 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook |url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day3otlk_20230322_0730.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322082200/https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day3otlk_20230322_0730.html |archive-date=March 22, 2023 |access-date=March 25, 2023 |publisher=Storm Prediction Center}}</ref> The enhanced risk was expanded northward the following day, and the original outlined area was upgraded to a level 4/moderate risk.<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Mosier |date=March 24, 2023 |title=Mar 23, 2023 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook |url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day2otlk_20230323_0600.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325122923/https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day2otlk_20230323_0600.html |archive-date=March 25, 2023 |access-date=March 25, 2023 |publisher=Storm Prediction Center}}</ref>

On March 24, water vapor imagery showed a potent mid-level trough. Strong mid-level winds between the trough and strong [[high-pressure area]] across the Southeastern United States were displaying in models as well. Meanwhile, a quickly deepening [[low-pressure area]] was expected to drag a [[warm front]] northward, leading to a broad, unstable air mass to its south.{{Clarify|reason=Specify the geography. Northward to where? And what was south of that area?|date=September 2023}} Although some reduction in moisture was expected across Mississippi due to drier air aloft and warm surface temperatures into the 80s Fahrenheit, continued [[advection]] of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico seemed supportive of [[dewpoint]]s in the upper 60s and lower 70's across [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Mississippi]] by the evening hours. Thus, mixed-layer [[convective available potential energy]] was expected to rise into the 1,500–2,000&nbsp;J/kg range.

A tornado watch was issued at 5:15&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|Central Daylight Time]] ([[UTC−05:00|UTC−5]]) for portions of eastern Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana, central and northern Mississippi, and western Tennessee.

At their 01:00 UTC outlook, the SPC lowered the probability of tornadoes to a 10% (significant) tornado area, thus downgrading the moderate risk to an enhanced risk. The SPC cited weaker than expected instability in the area, with increased confidence in only limited buoyancy developing. However, the same update noted that "a couple of longer-track supercells" and "a few strong tornadoes" remained possible.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |date=March 24, 2023 |title=Mar 25, 2023 0100 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook |url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day1otlk_20230325_0100.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414190221/https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2023/day1otlk_20230325_0100.html |archive-date=April 14, 2023 |access-date=July 12, 2023 |website=Storm Prediction Center |publisher=National Weather Service}}</ref>

[[File:Debarked trees and EF4 damage to a home southwest of Rolling Fork, Mississippi.jpg|thumb|left|A home along Pinkins Road, completely leveled at low-end EF4 intensity]]
The tornado first touched down in [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]], southeast of [[Mayersville, Mississippi|Mayersville]], which is east of the [[Mississippi River]], at 7:57 pm CDT. The exact location of where the tornado touched down has been debated between academic scholars;<ref name="NHESS">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Jingyu |last2=Wang |first2=Xianfeng |last3=Park |first3=Edward |last4=Lin |first4=Yun |title=Brief communication: Soil moisture observations reconcile the discrepancy in detecting tornado early-stage track during the 24–25 March 2023 Mississippi outbreak |url=https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2023-100/nhess-2023-100.pdf |website=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences |publisher=[[Copernicus Publications]] |access-date=1 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240201162713/https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2023-100/nhess-2023-100.pdf |archive-date=1 February 2024 |location=Singapore and Los Angeles |pages=1–10 |doi=10.5194/nhess-2023-100 |date=31 July 2023 |doi-access=free |url-status=live}}</ref> its official touch down point was placed south-southwest of the intersection of Turner Road and Grant Road. It tracked northeastward and caused EF1 damage to trees, a power pole, and outbuildings as it crossed Grant Road before moving through the [[Steele Bayou Canal]] and into [[Sharkey County, Mississippi|Sharkey County]], downing trees at EF1 intensity. The tornado then rapidly grew in size and strength as it approached [[Rolling Fork, Mississippi|Rolling Fork]] from the southwest, snapping and uprooting many trees in a wooded area at EF2 intensity, including some that sustained debarking. The tornado then reached low-end EF4 intensity and produced violent tree damage as it exited the wooded area, where severe debarking occurred, one tree was ripped out of the ground by its root ball, and pieces of shredded trees were thrown into an adjacent field. EF1 to EF2 damage occurred farther from the center of the tornado's damage path as it crossed Bear Lake Road, where a house lost its roof and exterior walls, and two residences west of that home lost significant portions of their roof covering. A mobile home was also rolled in this area. At that time, violent rotation of radar paired with a debris signature prompted the issuance of a [[tornado emergency]] by the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi at 8:04 pm CDT; the tornado would remain under this tag for most of its existence.<ref name="NOAA NCEI"/><ref name="NOAA ArcGIS"/> However, although the initial warning for Rolling Fork was issued well in advance, many residents stated that they did not receive any warning due to the cell service being down, the tornado sirens not going off, and the fast speed of the tornado. As a result, the tornado's arrival caught many people off guard with some of them not even knowing what had happened.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McArthur |first1=Danny |title=Tornado’s swift arrival in Rolling Fork highlights Gulf South’s emergency management needs |url=https://www.wwno.org/news/2023-04-19/tornados-swift-arrival-in-rolling-fork-highlights-gulf-souths-emergency-management-needs |access-date=25 November 2024 |work=WWNO |date=19 April 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, there are no public shelters in the town nor are the any in the rest of the Sharkey County and the surrounding counties. Thus, the residents that somehow did receive a warning were forced to take shelter within their homes and mobile homes, which proved to be inadequate.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Bracey |last2=Sánchez |first2=Emma |last3=Doyle |first3=Rory |title=Monster tornado in Rolling Fork laid bare a grim reality: Many had no hope of finding safety |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/monster-tornado-rolling-fork-laid-140010530.html |access-date=25 November 2024 |work=Yahoo News |date=7 December 2023}}</ref>

As it reached the southwestern outskirts of Rolling Fork, the tornado moved directly through the Indian Bayou subdivision along Pinkins Road at low-end EF4 intensity, where every single home (about 15 in all) was leveled, and a few were swept away. Most of the homes in the area were poorly constructed or were manufactured homes, though one frame home at this location was well built enough to earn a low-end EF4 rating. Violent contextual damage was also noted as large hardwood trees near the residences were severely debarked, some were stripped of their branches, cars were thrown into fields and destroyed, and debris was strewn long distances. One person was severely injured in this area and died four weeks later. Low-end EF4 damage continued as the tornado crossed [[Mississippi Highway 826|MS 826]], where a brick house was flattened, and many trees were debarked and left with only stubs of branches remaining. A large metal outbuilding was swept away at high-end EF2 intensity in this area as well. The tornado then weakened slightly, but remained intense, completely destroying a house near Oasis Drive at high-end EF3 intensity. The home was leveled, but it may have been struck by three nearby mobile homes that were thrown and destroyed. The tornado maintained EF3 strength as it entered the southwestern part of Rolling Fork.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Angela |date=2023-03-28 |title=NWS describes damage left in Mississippi by EF4 tornado |url=https://www.wapt.com/article/nws-describes-damage-left-in-mississippi-by-ef4-tornado/43441493 |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=WAPT |language=en |archive-date=2023-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230714164601/https://www.wapt.com/article/nws-describes-damage-left-in-mississippi-by-ef4-tornado/43441493 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As the tornado entered Rolling Fork at the southwest side of town, it weakened but remained intense as it produced widespread EF2 to EF3 damage as it moved through residential areas. Many houses sustained major structural damage with roofs completely removed and exterior walls destroyed, and a few were leveled. Manufactured homes were obliterated, debris was scattered throughout the area, and the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital sustained damage to its exterior.<ref name="DAT">{{cite web |title=Damage Assessment Toolkit |url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/ |access-date=March 25, 2023 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |archive-date=April 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423095631/https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="NWSJAN1" /> A couple was killed near 7th Street by a large semi-truck that was lofted and slammed into their home. Several structures at an agriculture business were also flattened. After briefly weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado rapidly increased to EF4 intensity again near the center of Rolling Fork at [[Mississippi Highway 14|MS 14]]. A large brick duplex was leveled and partially swept from its foundation and two warehouses near the center of town were obliterated. The local library and animal shelter were destroyed, the Rolling Fork Police Department sustained roof loss and some collapse of exterior walls, and the fire station, post office, city hall, Rolling Fork Elementary School, South Delta High School, and a church were significantly damaged. One person died in a mobile home that was destroyed.<ref name="DAT" /><ref name="NWSJAN1" />

Multiple older brick buildings in downtown Rolling Fork also sustained major structural damage. Several other well-built businesses and structures were leveled, with only piles of debris remaining; one of the structures had multiple tractor-trailers thrown into it. One of the town's water towers was toppled when flying debris compromised its base, leaving a crater where it impacted the ground. Water towers are not an official damage indicator on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]]; however, the National Weather Service rated the damage done to the tower EF4 with no estimated wind speed. Mechanical engineer Ethan Moriarty determined—assuming that the tower was made from one single piece of metal that was properly anchored and had not suffered environmental corrosion—that winds of at least {{convert|229|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} would be needed to cause the observed damage to the water tower.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Ethan Moriarty |title=DAMAGE ANALYSIS: Rolling Fork, MS EF4 Tornado |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mj34liL1dU |website=YouTube |publisher=@junefirst |access-date=11 July 2023 |date=7 April 2023 |archive-date=23 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230623024109/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mj34liL1dU |url-status=live }}</ref> Another fatality occurred near this area in another mobile home that was destroyed. Some of the most violent damage occurred in the northeastern part of town, where a flower shop housed in a well-built brick building was leveled at high-end EF4 strength, with its concrete foundation slab partially swept clean of debris. The National Weather Service determined that winds up to {{convert|195|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} would have been needed to cause the damage done to the flower shop. The survey team also noted that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity here based on the damage to the shop, but the neighboring building, which was a small salon, was only leveled and not swept away and received a high-end EF3 rating with winds of {{convert|165|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="DAT" /> As a result, there was not enough confidence in upgrading the tornado to EF5.<ref name="MaxOlsen"/> Several nearby homes were also obliterated at high-end EF4 strength with winds up to {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} while large metal-framed buildings, including a [[Family Dollar]] store along [[U.S. Route 61 in Mississippi|US 61]]/MS 14, were flattened as well. Two people were killed at the Family Dollar and a person traveling southbound in a truck on US 61/MS 14 died when the vehicle was thrown off of the highway. Chuck's Dairy Bar had a pickup truck thrown into it and was destroyed, but several people survived at that location by taking shelter in the business's walk-in cooler, the only part of the building left intact after the tornado's passage. Many vehicles were thrown through the air and left badly mangled, numerous large trees in and around Rolling Fork were denuded and debarked, and a few of them were stripped clean of all bark.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Kelly |title=Restaurant owner describes seeing the sky as she saved her staff from tornado |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/restaurant-owner-describes-sky-saved-staff-tornado/story?id=98145014 |access-date=28 March 2023 |work=ABC News |date=27 March 2023 |language=en |archive-date=March 27, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327225901/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/restaurant-owner-describes-sky-saved-staff-tornado/story?id=98145014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=EF4 tornado devastates Mississippi city: What to know about the EF scale |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/ef4-tornado-devastates-mississippi-city-what-to-know-about-the-ef-scale/ar-AA198iOG?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=4e01a22c02c74acf8bb9d85a3ba61844&ei=9 |access-date=28 March 2023 |work=MSN |archive-date=March 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230328203306/https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/ef4-tornado-devastates-mississippi-city-what-to-know-about-the-ef-scale/ar-AA198iOG?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=4e01a22c02c74acf8bb9d85a3ba61844&ei=9 |url-status=live }}</ref> The large tornado then struck a mobile home park on the eastern edge of town as it exited Rolling Fork, where several manufacturing homes were completely obliterated with debris being strewn long distances.

===Ground scouring and extreme forest damage===
[[File:Low-end EF4 tree damage and a school bus.jpg|thumb|right|Low-end EF4 tree damage and a school bus that was thrown into the trees southeast of Anguilla]]
After exiting Rolling Fork, the tornado remained violent as it moved across several open fields, where severe ground scouring occurred and debris from the town was scattered long distances to the northeast. When it crossed Matthews Boulevard near a catfish farm, several utility poles were snapped off at the base or pulled out of the ground, and some were left covered in up to {{convert|1|–|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} of mud. A few of the missing power poles were thrown into nearby catfish ponds, and damage in this area was rated EF2 to EF3. Southeast of [[Anguilla, Mississippi|Anguilla]], the tornado inflicted EF4-strength damage again to hardwood trees, with most mangled or debarked.<ref name="NWSJAN1" /> An outbuilding-type structure was obliterated and swept away with very little debris remaining, and a bus on the property was tossed into trees. Numerous additional wooden power poles were snapped, a semi-trailer was overturned, and a few homes at the edge of the damage path had minor damage. Aerial imagery of this area also revealed ground scouring and cycloidal marks in open fields. The tornado then moved into a densely forested area, causing large amounts of EF2 tree damage.<ref name="NWSJAN1" /><ref name="DAT" /> It crossed [[Mississippi Highway 14|MS 14]] east of Anguilla, destroying a small, older frame home, rolling a mobile home, and snapping many trees and power poles. The tornado then intensified back to low-end EF3 strength, mowing down large swaths of trees as it approached the county line.<ref name="DAT" /><ref name="NWSJAN1" />

===Midnight===
Maintaining low-end EF3 strength, the tornado then crossed into [[Humphreys County, Mississippi|Humphreys County]] and continued northeastward, where a home suffered partial destruction of its roof and garage. A truck inside the garage was overturned while another was moved, and a nearby shop building was destroyed, with its metal structural beams bent. Several power poles in the area were snapped and thrown into a nearby field as well. The tornado then briefly strengthened to high-end EF3 strength as it leveled a small brick home along Seven Mile Road, and overturned a nearby grain loader. Another home had most of its roof removed and part of a wall collapsed, with vehicles blown out of its garage. Some metal buildings were damaged or destroyed. Grain bins were heavily damaged in this area as well; debris, including a grain cart, was scattered for hundreds of yards into a field. Passing through the small community of [[Midnight, Mississippi|Midnight]], the tornado produced EF2 damage: a home and a few barns were destroyed, trees and power poles were snapped, a sign was blown over, and a metal building and a small brick building sustained roof damage. The tornado then moved northeast along [[Mississippi Highway 149|MS 149]], causing EF2 to EF3 damage as it approached [[Silver City, Mississippi|Silver City]] from the southwest. A mobile home was destroyed after being thrown {{convert|75|ft|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}} into a nearby field, with only the porch being left behind. A portion of the roof was blown off a school, several homes suffered partial roof loss, and two metal buildings were destroyed, with large support beams bent and debris scattered across fields. Large areas of hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, and multiple center pivot irrigation systems were flipped in this area as well.<ref name="NWSJAN1" /><ref name="DAT" />

===Silver City, weakening, and dissipation===
[[File:Silver City EF2 damage 2023.jpg|thumb|Widespread EF2 damage in Silver City]]
The tornado then weakened some but continued causing significant damage as it moved into Silver City, where multiple apartment buildings on the western side of the town suffered heavy roof damage, including some that had portions of their roofs removed and one that had its walls partially collapsed; one person was killed at this location. Many homes throughout the town had extensive roof damage; some lost their roofs completely, and a few sustained collapse of one or more exterior walls. Four manufactured homes were destroyed in the center of town, a church along [[U.S. Route 49W|US 49W]] sustained roof damage, a large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted, and power lines were downed. One person was killed when a mobile home was thrown into their home and a child was killed in a mobile home that was destroyed. Damage in Silver City was rated EF2 in intensity. The tornado then weakened further and moved northeastward into rural forested areas, downing trees and causing roof and window damage to a few homes near and along [[Mississippi Highway 12|MS 12]] to the east of [[Belzoni, Mississippi|Belzoni]], with damage in this area being rated EF0 to EF1. It then moved into [[Holmes County, Mississippi|Holmes County]], where more trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49E|US 49E]] north of [[Tchula, Mississippi|Tchula]]. The tornado produced a final small area of significant damage, snapping or uprooting large tree trunks at EF2 intensity in the [[Morgan Brake National Wildlife Refuge]]. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened again and produced additional EF0 to EF1 damage as it overturned pivot irrigation systems, damaged trees, and flipped or destroyed grain bins. It dissipated after crossing Randle Road at 9:08 pm CDT.<ref name="NOAA NCEI"/><ref name="NOAA ArcGIS"/>

In total, the tornado traveled {{convert|59.4|mi|km}}, killing 17 people and injuring 165 others.<ref name="DAT" /><ref name="NWSJAN1">{{cite report |url=https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=PNSJAN&e=202303280208 |title=NWS Damage Survey for March 24 tornado event |author=National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi |date=March 27, 2023 |publisher=Iowa Environmental Mesonet |access-date=March 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230328020912/https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=PNSJAN&e=202303280208 |archive-date=March 28, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Will McDuffie|title=7 dead in 'destructive' Mississippi tornado, official says|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/7-dead-mississippi-tornado-official/story?id=98117564|publisher=ABC News|date=March 24, 2023|access-date=March 25, 2023|archive-date=March 25, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325115911/https://abcnews.go.com/US/7-dead-mississippi-tornado-official/story?id=98117564|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=May 4, 2023 |title=Mississippi death toll from March tornado climbs to 22 |work=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-tornado-death-a6a9d3deebf01356d4851d5913b78fa3 |url-status=live |access-date=May 10, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230505071714/https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-tornado-death-a6a9d3deebf01356d4851d5913b78fa3 |archive-date=May 5, 2023}}</ref><ref name="NWS195" /> The tornado moved with an average forward speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Speed Distance Time Calculator |url=https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/speed-distance-time-calculator.php?given_data=ds_dt_va&ds=59.4&ds_units=mile&va_units=mile+per+hour&dt=71&dt_units=minute&given_data_last=ds_dt_va&action=solve |publisher=Calculator Soup |access-date=11 July 2023 |archive-date=11 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230711044603/https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/speed-distance-time-calculator.php?given_data=ds_dt_va&ds=59.4&ds_units=mile&va_units=mile+per+hour&dt=71&dt_units=minute&given_data_last=ds_dt_va&action=solve |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Possible EF5 intensity===

In March 2024, Logan Poole, a meteorologist and damage surveyor with the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi gave an interview regarding the tornado and why it was rated EF4 rather than EF5.<ref name="MaxOlsen">{{cite web |last1=Olsen |first1=Max |last2=Poole |first2=Logan |title=Is That a Car Flying Around This EF-4 Tornado? - The Mystery Continues |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaYOCI-0K4 |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Max Olson Chasing |access-date=19 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240719171231/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaYOCI-0K4 |archive-date=19 July 2024 |format=[[Video]] |date=12 March 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the interview, Poole stated:

{{Blockquote
|text="So, what gave it the 195 mark? And, the best answer to that is what didn't give it the 200 mark...The Green Apple Florist, essentially a single family home that was modified to {{as written|bui|lt}} to be a floral shop and it is slabbed to the ground and swept clean. Why not F5? Why not EF5? And two things really stuck out to us from the consensus on why not EF5. One was this building, even though it was extremely, extremely destroyed, I mean on its own, taken out of context, I think most people would agree this would be representative of an EF5 tornado; the damage to that building...If there had even been two of these side-by-side that had suffered the same fate, then maybe we could have had more confidence on that, but we didn't...But it was, to that point that we were very very close and this is probably about as close as you'll get across that threshold, without making it...A question we get a whole lot is like how can you be so sure that it was a five miles per hour from F5, but not quite there? And the answer to that is we aren't. What the EF-scale is, is a damage scale...Is it possible that it had winds that were stronger? Certainly."

On January 23, 2025, Anthony W. Lyza with the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] along with Harold E. Brooks and Makenzie J. Kroca with the [[University of Oklahoma]]’s School of Meteorology published a paper to the [[American Meteorological Society]], where they stated the Rolling Fork tornado was an "EF5 candidate" at the floral shop.
