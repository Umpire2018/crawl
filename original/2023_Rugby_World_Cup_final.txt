==Match==
===Summary===
====First half====
In the 2nd minute, New Zealand's [[Shannon Frizell]] received a yellow card for falling on top of the leg of [[Bongi Mbonambi]]. Mbonambi was forced off for the remainder of the match with a knee injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/world-cup-final-bongi-mbonambi-injury-card-b2437755.html|title=South Africa's Bongi Mbonambi suffers Rugby World Cup final heartbreak with injury|date=28 October 2023|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 November 2023}}</ref>
South Africa went on to take a 6–0 lead with two penalties converted by [[Handré Pollard]] before [[Richie Mo'unga]] scored for New Zealand with a penalty after 17 minutes. Pollard scored another penalty two minutes later to make it 9–3.<ref>{{cite news |last1=AINSWORTH |first1=IMOGEN |title=NEW ZEALAND 11-12 SOUTH AFRICA: SPRINGBOKS CLAIM RECORD FOURTH WORLD CUP WITH NARROW WIN OVER 14-MAN ALL BLACKS |url=https://www.eurosport.com/rugby/world-cup/2023/new-zealand-v-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-live_sto9855397/story.shtml |access-date=29 October 2023 |work=[[Eurosport]] |date=28 October 2023}}</ref> 
In the 28th minute, New Zealand's captain [[Sam Cane]] was given a yellow card for a high shoulder tackle to the head of South Africa's [[Jesse Kriel]] which was later upgraded to a red card after a bunker review.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/67189579|title=Rugby World Cup 2023 final: New Zealand & South Africa's rivalry and history|date=23 October 2023|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 October 2023}}</ref> Pollard scored another penalty in the 34th minute before Mo'unga replied with his second penalty to leave the score 12–6 at half-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup/south-africa-12-new-zealand-11-as-it-happened-springboks-see-off-brave-effort-from-14-man-all-blacks-by-minimum/a292668695.html|title=South Africa 12 New Zealand 11 as it happened: Springboks see off brave effort from 14-man All Blacks by minimum|date=28 October 2023|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=1 November 2023}}</ref>

====Second half====
In the 45th minute, South African captain [[Siya Kolisi]] received a yellow card for a head high tackle on [[Ardie Savea]] which was also reviewed for a potential red card. On review, it remained a yellow card. In the 54th minute, New Zealand thought that they had scored a try. [[Aaron Smith (rugby union)|Aaron Smith]] went over the try line in the left corner. However, the TMO review showed that the ball had been knocked on by Ardie Savea before it was released from the initial lineout.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby-world-cup/2023/1028/1413502-rwc-final-new-zealand-v-south-africa-build-up/|title=Rugby World Cup final: Springboks retain World Cup after thriller with New Zealand|date=28 October 2023|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=1 November 2023}}</ref>
They did get a try in the 58th minute. [[Beauden Barrett]] went over the try line on the left after an offload from [[Mark Tele'a]]. Richie Mo'unga missed the conversion from the left that would have put New Zealand in front. With 7 minutes to go, [[Cheslin Kolbe]] received a yellow card for a deliberate knock on and New Zealand missed the critical penalty to seal their victory. South Africa held on to win 12–11 and claim their fourth World Cup title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/oct/28/rugby-world-cup-final-new-zealand-v-south-africa-live-score-updates|title=Rugby World Cup 2023 final: New Zealand 11-12 South Africa – as it happened|date=28 October 2023|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2023}}</ref>
