From July 14 to November 9, 2023, the American actors' union [[SAG-AFTRA]] (Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) went [[on strike]] over a [[labor dispute]] with the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP). It was the longest actors' strike against the film and TV studios in Hollywood history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maddaus |first=Gene |date=2023-11-08 |title=SAG-AFTRA Approves Deal to End Historic Strike |url=https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/sag-aftra-tentative-deal-historic-strike-1235771894/ |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> Its duration overlapped significantly with the [[2023 Writers Guild of America strike]]. 

Along with the [[2023 Writers Guild of America strike]] (which ended on September 27, 2023),<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kilkenny |first1=Katie |title=Writers Guild Strike to End Wednesday: Leadership Votes to Conclude Historic Work Stoppage |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/writers-guild-strike-end-1235600992/ |access-date=September 26, 2023 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=September 26, 2023 |archive-date=September 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928000038/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/writers-guild-strike-end-1235600992/amp/ |url-status=live }}</ref> it was part of a series of [[2023 Hollywood labor disputes|broader Hollywood labor disputes]].

It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the [[1980 actors strike]] and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.

Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11 and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached.
