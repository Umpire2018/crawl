==Electoral system==
=== President ===
The [[President of Sierra Leone]] is elected using a modified version of the [[two-round system]], with a candidate having to receive more than 55% of the vote in the first round to be elected. If this is not done, a second round must be held two weeks after the announcement of the first-round result.

=== Parliament ===
Members of Parliament were elected in 16 multi-member constituencies (of between four and sixteen seats) coterminous with the [[Districts of Sierra Leone]] by [[proportional representation]] via the [[largest remainder method]] (with the [[Hare quota]]),<ref>[https://ecslmedia.ec.gov.sl/pdfviewer/public-elections-act-2022-2/ The Public Elections Act, 2022]</ref><ref>[https://ecslmedia.ec.gov.sl/pdfviewer/pr-regulation/ THE PUBLIC ELECTIONS (LOCAL COUNCILS PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION SYSTEM) REGULATIONS, 2022]</ref> after a presidential decree by [[Julius Maada Bio]] in October 2022 abolished the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system that had been used since 2008.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-africa-62845575?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=6352b28d40fad4042da78932%26Sierra%20Leone%20plans%20controversial%20return%20to%20old%20voting%20system%262022-10-21T17%3A03%3A17.361Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:6934754b-be84-4770-9b53-6d623756dd3d&pinned_post_asset_id=6352b28d40fad4042da78932&pinned_post_type=share Sierra Leone plans controversial return to old voting system] BBC News, 21 October 2022</ref> Independent candidates are eligible to run and win seats if they exceed the quota required for one in a constituency. A total of 14 additional seats (one per district, excluding the two districts of the Western Area) are not elected, and are reserved for [[Paramount chief|paramount chiefs]]. 

The [[Supreme Court of Sierra Leone]] ruled that the decree changing the electoral system was constitutional in a case brought by opposition MP Abdul Kargbo and local councillor Hakiratu Maxwell-Caulker.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Abdul Rashid |date=27 January 2023 |title=Sierra Leone will go to the polls in June under proportional representation – Supreme Court rules |url=https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/sierra-leone-will-go-to-the-polls-in-june-under-proportional-representation-supreme-court-rules/ |access-date=30 May 2023 |website=The Sierra Leone Telegraph |language=en-US}}</ref>

European election observers stated that there were "statistical inconsistencies" in the presidential results published, with the European Union Election Observation Mission calling for the electoral commission to "publish disaggregated results data per polling station to allow for public scrutiny of the results," without which it said transparency was compromised.
