Presidential elections were held in Singapore on 1 September 2023, the sixth public [[presidential elections in Singapore|presidential elections]] but only the third to be contested by more than one candidate. Incumbent president [[Halimah Yacob]], who had been [[Uncontested election|elected unopposed]] in [[2017 Singaporean presidential election|2017]], did not seek re-election.

Three candidates ran for the [[Non-partisan democracy|non-partisan]] position: [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]], [[Ng Kok Song]], and [[Tan Kin Lian]], who were all [[Independent politician|independents]] or had resigned from any political parties that they had previously been members of. They were all issued the [[Certificate of Eligibility]] (COE), and a community certificate, to be able to contest in the elections, per the eligibility requirements.

Tharman won a majority of the votes, at 70.41% of the votes and winning by a record margin. He also became the first non-Chinese candidate to be directly elected to the presidency.<ref name="TW-PE2023">{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=Tessa |title=Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Singapore picks a president who could've been much more |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66643667 |access-date=6 September 2023 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 September 2023}}</ref> Ng received 15.72% of the vote and two-time presidential candidate Tan received 13.87%, the latter having improved his performance over [[2011 Singaporean presidential election|2011]] when he had done so poorly as to lose his [[election deposit]].

Under amendments to bills of 8 March, minors under the age of 16 (previously applied to students studying in primary or secondary schools) and foreign entities (such as companies or organisations) are barred from any political involvement to prevent exploitation, though they can still participate in election-related activities such as attending rallies. Foreign individuals remained barred from involvement under previous laws.<ref name="Bill"/> The election expenditure limit is capped at either S$600,000 or 30 cents per registered voter, whichever amount is greater. The latter amount was announced on 12 August to be S$812,822.10, higher than the minimum of S$600,000.

Campaign posters were placed immediately following the nominations, with Tharman's posters being put up first, followed by Tan's shortly after. Only Ng abstained from doing so, citing "limited resources" and environmental concerns – instead, he announced that he would rely on social media to spread his campaign message.<ref>{{cite web |title=No posters, banners for Ng Kok Song's campaign due to 'limited resources', sustainable reasons |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-ng-kok-song-posters-banners-environmentally-friendly-lack-resources-3718126 |website=CNA |access-date=23 August 2023 |archive-date=23 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230823133512/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-ng-kok-song-posters-banners-environmentally-friendly-lack-resources-3718126 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the second day, Ng warned the media that the relationship between the president and the prime minister should not be "too close", as it would then be difficult for the president to discharge their duties objectively. He added that he would schedule an online rally.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ng Kok Song warns against President-PM relationship that is 'too close'; difficult to carry out duties objectively |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-president-prime-minister-pm-relationship-presidential-election-3720676 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824144641/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-president-prime-minister-pm-relationship-presidential-election-3720676 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 28 August, in light of Tan Cheng Bock's endorsement of Tan, Ng Kok Song questioned Tan's political independence. Ng stated that it was questionable for Tan to claim to be an independent candidate when he has been dependent on opposition party leaders, additionally accusing Tan of "making a mockery of the presidency" and that "political parties should wait for the next general election to make their point instead of confusing voters into thinking that this is a general election".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lau |first1=Jean |title=Ng Kok Song questions Tan Kin Lian's independence after Tan Cheng Bock endorsement |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ng-kok-song-questions-tan-kin-lian-s-independence-after-tan-cheng-bock-endorsement |website=The Straits Times |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |date=28 August 2023 |archive-date=30 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830024508/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ng-kok-song-questions-tan-kin-lian-s-independence-after-tan-cheng-bock-endorsement |url-status=live }}</ref> Ng also concluded that such blatant political endorsements of Tan polarise voters by politicising the presidential election and that by doing so have "dishonoured the office of the President as a unifying non-partisan position."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ong Guang-Xi |first1=Justin |title=Opposition members' endorsement of Tan Kin Lian polarises voters by politicising Presidential Election: Ng Kok Song |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-ng-kok-song-opposition-members-endorsing-tan-kin-lian-polarise-singaporeans-politicise-3727801 |website=CNA |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=28 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230828082729/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-ng-kok-song-opposition-members-endorsing-tan-kin-lian-polarise-singaporeans-politicise-3727801 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Later that evening, a police report was lodged against a man on a bicycle who disrupted and heckled Ng and his team while Ng conducted his walkabout at [[Clementi, Singapore|Clementi]]. The man had attempted to ram people with his bicycle, launched into an expletive-laden rant, and then repeatedly shouted Tan's name before he left the scene.

====First Presidential Candidate Broadcast====
The first of the two rounds of the Presidential Candidate Broadcast was held on 24 August; the order of the candidates appearing in this round was based on the alphabetical order of their surnames.<ref>{{cite web |title='Ownself check ownself', diversity of views, not just scholars for top jobs: Ng Kok Song, Tharman and Tan Kin Lian deliver PCB speeches |url=https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-tharman-tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-election |website=AsiaOne |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |date=24 August 2023 |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824143820/https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-tharman-tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-election |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Watch: Singapore presidential candidate broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/watch-presidential-candidate-broadcast-election-tv-cna-3718426 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824143819/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/watch-presidential-candidate-broadcast-election-tv-cna-3718426 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ng said that "the time has come" for a president to be fully non-partisan and said that he was neither endorsed nor represented by a political party, specifically the ruling People's Action Party. He said that the president's role would serve as a "constitutional check" on a bad government that might raid the country's reserves, or appoint incompetent or corrupt individuals to key public-service positions. He added that Singapore can "no longer take for granted" that it will always have a "good and honest" government, adding that there is a need for external checks, as with good corporate governance, and that an "ownself check ownself" system is not reliable. He also pledged to "Do Well, Do Right and Do Good" to provide resilience of body and mind.<ref>{{cite web |title=The time has come for a non-partisan President, says Ng Kok Song in presidential candidate broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-presidential-candidate-broadcast-time-non-partisan-president-3721061 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824143821/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-presidential-candidate-broadcast-time-non-partisan-president-3721061 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tharman said that he would bring his ideal of "independence of mind" and "respect", should he be elected, and that he wanted to become a "unifying figure at home and to advance Singapore's interests abroad". He added that modern-day Singapore's democracy, as well as the current political climate in the world, were diverse but also challenging at times, concerning a political divide. He also had plans to voice views in Singapore so as to prove that Singapore would "never become just another small country" and said that he was an "optimist in our future".<ref>{{cite web |title=In presidential candidate broadcast, Tharman vows to bring 'independence of mind' as President |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-tharman-shanmugaratnam-broadcast-message-3720281 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824143819/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-tharman-shanmugaratnam-broadcast-message-3720281 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tan highlighted two key duties of the president, given his 30 years prior experience as a CEO of [[Income Insurance|NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative]]. One, to safeguard Singapore's reserves, he intends to invest "prudently" with the support of the [[Government of Singapore|government]] for the benefit of Singaporeans. Two, to protect the integrity of public service. He values the efforts of, and emphasises the need for, talented people with many years of working experience and possessing practical skills, not just scholars, to form a good team, and that he would give such people the opportunity to be promoted to leadership positions. He also stated that he did not intend to be an "adversary to the elected government", but said that he would collaborate more with the government and reiterated his belief in the "spirit of unity and pride", as well as connecting with ordinary people and "their hardship and aspirations".<ref>{{cite web |title=Vital to have different types of people in public service, not just scholars: Tan Kin Lian in presidential candidate broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-public-service-different-people-scholars-3721046 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824143822/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-public-service-different-people-scholars-3721046 |url-status=live }}</ref> Prior to the broadcast, both ELD and the [[Infocomm Media Development Authority]] had amended Tan's script by removing some inaccuracies, specifically on the president's role and on soliciting voters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tan Kin Lian takes issue with edits to broadcast speech; IMDA, ELD cite 'inaccuracies' on President's role |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-imda-eld-president-role-inaccuracies-remove-3721546 |website=CNA |access-date=24 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=24 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230824145209/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-imda-eld-president-role-inaccuracies-remove-3721546 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====CNA Presidential Forum====
The [[CNA (TV network)|CNA]] forum was held on 28 August at about 21:09, with Otelli Edwards hosting. Eight questions are asked of three candidates in order, each making closing statements:<ref>{{cite web |title=Watch: Singapore presidential candidates make pitch for votes in televised forum |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-presidential-election-forum-candidates-watch-live-3724341 |access-date=28 August 2023 |archive-date=28 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230828165154/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-presidential-election-forum-candidates-watch-live-3724341 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Looking at candidates' political ties 'simplistic', rules out even senior civil servants, says Tharman in presidential forum |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/president-election-forum-political-ties-ng-kok-song-tharman-shanmugaratnam-tan-kin-lian-3730021 |website=CNA |access-date=29 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=29 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829000522/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/president-election-forum-political-ties-ng-kok-song-tharman-shanmugaratnam-tan-kin-lian-3730021 |url-status=live }}</ref>

* What experience and expertise do you possess, that make you the most qualified candidate to be the President?
* Beyond what the Government tells you, what [[Reserve power|factors]] would you consider before using the [[Separation of powers|second key]] to the [[Reserves of the Government of Singapore|Past Reserves]]?
* How can you convince voters you are not [[Politicization|politicising]] the election and will exercise your powers without fear or favour?
* What unique traits do you possess that will help you [[Foreign relations of Singapore|represent Singapore on the global stage]]?
* What role would you play as president to build a more inclusive and compassionate society?
* How do you plan to connect with young Singaporeans and involve them in writing the next chapter of the Singapore story?
* Beyond your ceremonial and community roles, how do you intend to be a unifying figure for the nation?
* What major challenges will Singapore face and how will you, within the [[Powers of the President of Singapore|powers of the President]], help Singaporeans to cope?

The forum was [[rerun]] on [[Channel 5 (Singaporean TV channel)|Channel 5]] at 21:00 the day after, 29 August.

====Second Presidential Candidate Broadcast====
The second of the two rounds of the Presidential Candidate Broadcast was held on 30 August; the order of the candidates appearing in this round of broadcast was reversed from the first round.<ref>{{cite web |title=Watch: Second Singapore presidential candidate broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/watch-presidential-candidate-broadcast-second-election-tv-cna-3731226 |website=CNA |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=30 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830141239/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/watch-presidential-candidate-broadcast-second-election-tv-cna-3731226 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tan Kin Lian acknowledged that the president has no executive authority over day-to-day issues, particularly those affecting younger people, but that he could focus on using "soft influence" to encourage change, hoping to "achieve our common goals for the benefit of Singapore". Furthermore, he publicly apologised in response to the criticism he had received over his social media posts about women from some sectors of the public, specifically from the [[Association of Women for Action and Research]] (AWARE). He added that he would be "more mindful of what I say" going forward. Tan also highlighted that one could factor his experience as president from making "sound investment decisions" at NTUC Income and from representing the country in an international insurance federation.<ref>{{cite web |title=No executive authority but I can use 'soft influence', says Tan Kin Lian in final presidential candidate broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-soft-influence-3734196 |website=CNA |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=30 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830130959/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-presidential-candidate-broadcast-soft-influence-3734196 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tharman highlighted his track record of connecting with people from all backgrounds in his former Taman Jurong division of [[Jurong GRC]], from when he was a member of parliament (MP) of the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) for 22 years—his ministerial positions including being [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister of Finance]], [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Senior Minister of Singapore|Senior Minister]]—and from his experience working with international organisations such as the [[G20]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the United Nations (UN), and the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF). He also mentioned that the demands on the president have increased due to the "new and challenging future" where Singaporeans faced an increasing trend of "profound global risks and uncertainties", and to "differentiate him from an actual partisan candidate", stressing that his motives, despite his political background, have "never been politically partisan".<ref>{{cite web |title=In final presidential candidate broadcast, Tharman points to track record of working on the ground in Jurong |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tharman-final-presidential-candidate-broadcast-people-all-backgrounds-3734271 |website=CNA |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=30 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830130938/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tharman-final-presidential-candidate-broadcast-people-all-backgrounds-3734271 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ng warned that politics in Singapore have become "highly contestable". He added that the country cannot afford to have a president who may be beholden to political parties, to serve their agenda, and reiterated the flaw in relying on an "ownself check ownself" mechanism. He believed the current generational transition of the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) government carries "uncertainties and risks" which have been due to scandals plaguing the party over the past month – such as the arrests of Transport Minister [[S Iswaran]] over allegations of corruption, and the resignations of MPs [[Tan Chuan-Jin]] and [[Cheng Li Hui]] over an extramarital affair. He also alluded to Tharman, by questioning whether it is appropriate for an ex-finance minister who "had set fiscal policies to then move across the table and become the president and be a check on the very policies that he had put in place". He also brought up the 1984 [[National Day Rally]] speech of then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]], stating that Singaporeans should be aware of "silver-tongued politicians who make empty promises". He concluded that Singapore needs a truly independent president, like himself, to break from its past of having a president always endorsed by the PAP, to protect the country's reserves from being squandered by a potential rogue government.<ref>{{cite web |title='No longer a remote possibility' for Singapore to have 'wrong team' in charge: Ng Kok Song in final broadcast |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-final-broadcast-speech-wrong-team-remote-possibility-3734116 |website=CNA |access-date=30 August 2023 |language=en |archive-date=30 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830141302/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ng-kok-song-final-broadcast-speech-wrong-team-remote-possibility-3734116 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 20 October, the presidential candidates' expenditure reports were published by the Elections Department. According to the reports, Tharman had spent S$738,717, Ng S$312,131, and Tan S$71,366.<ref name="Expenditure">{{cite web |title=President Tharman spent over S$700,000 on election campaign, highest among candidates |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-spending-tharman-700000-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-3860321 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Who spent what: 5 things we learnt from the expense filings of the Presidential Election candidates |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-presidential-election-eld-expense-report-tharman-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-3860806 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref> By comparison, in the previous presidential election in 2017, which was not contested, sole candidate Yacob had reported spending S$220,875.<ref>{{cite web |title=President Halimah Yacob spent more than S$220,000 on election campaign |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/president-halimah-yacob-spent-more-s220000-election-campaign-993446 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

Tharman also reported the receipt of about S$800,000 in donations from eight different donors, and stated in his expenditure report that the unspent amounts would be returned to their respective donors. Tan received donations amounting to about S$41,800 from about 120 donors, and reported that Tan Cheng Bock and Chee Soon Juan were not amongst his donors. Ng financed his campaign using his own personal funds and therefore did not report having received any donations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who spent what: 5 things we learnt from the expense filings of the Presidential Election candidates |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-presidential-election-eld-expense-report-tharman-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-3860806 |access-date=2023-11-04 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=President Tharman spent over S$700,000 on election campaign, highest among candidates |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-spending-tharman-700000-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-3860321 |access-date=2023-11-04 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref>

===Cooling-off day controversy===
On 2 October, the Elections Department reported that they had filed police reports on both [[M Ravi]] and [[Iris Koh]], the founders of anti-vaccination activist group Healing the Divide, for repeatedly publishing online election advertising on [[TikTok]] and [[Facebook]] during both the cooling-off period and Polling Day, when campaigning and advertising are strictly prohibited. According to media reports, Koh had also accused journalists of bias whilst at Tan's residence after polls closed. The assistant Returning Officer of the Elections Department issued correction requests to [[TikTok]] and [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], and all the relevant videos posted by them were removed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Police reports filed against Iris Koh, M Ravi for potentially breaking Presidential Election cooling-off rules |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iris-koh-m-ravi-presidential-election-cooling-period-police-3813681 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

On 2 September 2023, shortly after the announcement of the election results, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] congratulated Tharman Shanmugaratnam on his election, citing confidence in Tharman's ability to carry out his new duties as president "with distinction" and intention to work closely with the government. Lee also thanked the two losing candidates for their participation, the election officials for their hard work, and overseas voters for fulfilling their civic duty. Now that the election was over, Lee urged Singapore to "tackle the challenges ahead and build a stronger and more united nation".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shafeeq |first=Syarafana |date=2 September 2023 |title=PM Lee congratulates Tharman on winning presidency by 'decisive margin' |language=en |work=The Straits Times |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/pm-lee-congratulates-tharman-on-winning-presidency-by-decisive-margin |access-date=2023-09-01 |issn=0585-3923 |archive-date=2 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230902014817/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/pm-lee-congratulates-tharman-on-winning-presidency-by-decisive-margin |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Ministers]] [[Lawrence Wong]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Lawrence Wong congratulates Tharman on victory, calls it a 'vote of confidence in S'pore's future' |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/lawrence-wong-tharman/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref> and [[Heng Swee Keat]] also congratulated Tharman in separate posts, so did Lee's wife, [[Ho Ching]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Ho Ching congratulates Tharman on 'clear mandate' |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/ho-ching-congratulates-tharman/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=3 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> and his younger brother [[Lee Hsien Yang|Hsien Yang]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lee Hsien Yang congratulates President-elect Tharman, says the latter needs to be the independent president he said he would be, and speak truth to power – Singapore News |url=https://theindependent.sg/lee-hsien-yang-congratulates-president-elect-tharman/ |website=The Independent Singapore News |access-date=6 September 2023 |date=4 September 2023}}</ref>

The other candidates separately congratulated Tharman. Ng Kok Song, on his media at [[one-north]], said that he had achieved the "No. 1 goal" of allowing Singaporeans an opportunity to vote, which was his main objective while standing for the presidency. He further thanked Singaporeans for their recognition and pledged that he would continue to work with them, and also added that "non-partisanship will now enter the vocabulary of governance in Singapore".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Iau |first1=Jean |last2=Begum |first2=Shabana |last3=Tan |first3=Cheryl |title=Ng Kok Song says he achieved 'No. 1 goal' of giving S'poreans chance to vote |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ng-kok-song-concedes-presidential-election-says-he-achieved-goal-of-giving-s-poreans-chance-to-vote |website=The Straits Times |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en |date=2 September 2023}}</ref> At his residence in [[Yio Chu Kang]], Tan Kin Lian announced that he would, on his family's advice, "take things easy", and thanked his supporters and the opposition figures who were present for their support.

Several other labour unions also sent congratulatory messages to Tharman: Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman and former [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] Neil Parekh wrote that the community has benefitted much from Tharman's good counsel, and would invite him as a guest-of-honour for the chamber's centenary celebrations in 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Singapore Indian business community congratulates President-elect Tharman {{!}} Politics |url=https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/2579314-singapore-indian-business-community-congratulates-president-elect-tharman |website=Devdiscourse |access-date=6 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

In the early morning, the [[Taman Jurong]] Market and Food Centre was crowded in celebration of Tharman's election, with his supporters bringing out pineapples, chanting ''Ong lai huat ah'' (lit. Good Fortune), and singing the national anthem, "[[Majulah Singapura]]". Tharman visited several sites, such as Marsiling Mall (with Senior Minister of State and [[Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC|Marsiling]]'s MP [[Zaqy Mohamad]]), then [[Our Tampines Hub]], and [[HDB Hub]], to thank supporters.<ref>{{cite web |title=President-elect Tharman Shanmugaratnam thanks supporters with pineapples after election win |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-tharman-shanmugaratnam-victory-parade-thanks-supporters-pineapples-3742041 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> In a prior interview before results were announced, Tharman was "humbled" by how Singaporeans had trusted him for many years and called the election a "vote of optimism for a future".

==Analysis==

===Pre-Nomination Day===
On 14 August ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|TODAY]]'' interviewed 15 first-time [[Presidential elections in Singapore|presidential election]] voters, with ages ranging from 21 to 33, on their knowledge of the elected presidency. Their responses ranged from a few who indicated little knowledge or interest in politics to a handful who understood the topic well.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Read: First-time voters can play key role in deciding presidential race – do they care enough? |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/big-read-first-time-voters-presidential-race-3695086 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

The following day, ''TODAY'' and [[CNA (TV network)|CNA]] conducted a survey of 1,500 first-time voters, where the vast majority of them understood most of the presidential roles. The roles of being a symbolic figure and a diplomat were identified by about 95% of them, followed by at 91% knowing about the requirements of caring for the community and consulting with the Council of Presidential Advisors, with 88.4% understanding that the president is required to safeguard [[Reserves of the Government of Singapore|asset reserves]]. Only 36.1% knew that the president does not take orders from [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]].<ref name="CNA-3" />

''TODAY'' and CNA conducted another survey about the relationship between Parliament and the President, where some knew that the elected president generally takes instructions from the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]]. Analysts revealed that most first-time voters having a poor understanding of the election may imply that they have little to no interest in politics. Former Member of Parliament [[Inderjit Singh (Singaporean politician)|Inderjit Singh]] hinted that these first-timers may be "swayed by populist manifestos of some candidates without having the opportunity to verify facts". Kantar Public analyst Leong Chan-Hoong noted significant changes with educated Singaporeans in mind, and that the young voters may not be apparent to such a demographic.<ref name="CNA-3">{{cite web |title=Most first-time voters understand President's roles, less clear on relationship with government: CNA-TODAY survey |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-first-time-voters-president-cna-today-survey-3661611 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

===On Nomination Day===
When candidates were confirmed on 18 August, many political analysts predicted that Tharman Shanmugaratnam would win and cited the slate of candidates being "very different" with candidates being from two racial groups. Institute of Policy Studies Senior Researcher Gillian Koh suggested that the voters would find it difficult to resist Tharman's "unparalleled international standing". Associate Professor of law at [[Singapore Management University]] [[Eugene Tan]] predicted that people would "assume his victory is a foregone conclusion" but that should not be taken for granted. Tan thought it praiseworthy that the three candidates had experience in making strategic decisions with regard to the management of large funds, as well as having fine reputations.<ref name="CNA-5" />

Analysts had differing views regarding [[George Goh]]'s ineligibility to run for the presidency. Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, was surprised that Goh was ineligible. To him, Goh could bring something unique to the table, due to his private sector experience. It would give voters an additional choice. Eugene Tan agreed with Goh being ineligible, highlighting the difference in calculating the required shareholder equity of S$500&nbsp;million on the basis of one, versus many, companies. To him, one S$500&nbsp;million company is different from running five hundred S$1&nbsp;million companies. Therefore, he felt that the [[Presidential Elections Committee]]'s decision was understandable.<ref name="CNA-5">{{cite web |title=All 3 candidates who qualified for Presidential Election face challenges ahead: Analysts |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-challenges-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-tharman-3707696 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

===During campaigning period===
On 27 August, [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) Sociologist Ern Ser Tan noted on [[LinkedIn]] that there was an "undercurrent" with the election turning on maintaining the current political order versus seeking regime change, with the likelihood of political transformation. He added that, with [[Tan Kin Lian]]'s involvement with [[Tan Cheng Bock]] and [[Tan Jee Say]], the election has become clearly defined by the differences between the political orders of the ruling government and the opposition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ern Ser Tan on LinkedIn: ON PE23: an update from the perspective of an observer It was only a few… |url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ern-ser-tan-76028447_on-pe23-an-update-from-the-perspective-of-activity-7101564233175224320-6YXi |website=linkedin.com |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> NUS Arts and Social Science Lecturer Rebecca Grace Tan was reported to have referred the term 'Independent' to that of the People's Action Party, and that Tharman's decisive win wasn't decisive in signifying that non-partisanship was the primary deciding factor for many voters. Tan's opposition support sowed further doubts about the advantages of being non-partisan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did opposition backing help or hurt Tan Kin Lian in the Presidential Election? |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-presidential-election-opposition-support-tan-cheng-bock-3747091 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

In light of the "One vote, Three presidents?" slogan which surfaced on 28 August, political observers began to query Tan Kin Lian about the assertion that he is an "independent candidate". Eugene Tan commented that "It effectively asserts that if Tan (Kin Lian) wins, he will attempt to transform the presidency into a partisan institution" and further stated that a non-partisan president "must be above the political fray". Eugene Tan believed that party endorsements or endorsements by politicians can make the president beholden to the opposition politicians and ruin the presidency.<ref name="TODAY" />

School of Social Sciences, at the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (NTU), Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah's analysis suggests that Tan Kin Lian was attempting to position himself as the "ultimate anti-establishment candidate". Felix Tan, another lecturer at NTU, said that voting for Tan would suggest voting for opposition, which belies being non-partisan,<ref name="TODAY">{{cite web |title=PE 2023: Analysts say opposition backing, '3-in-1 presidents' claim cast doubt over Tan Kin Lian's independence |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/pe-2023-tan-kin-lian-independent-doubt-analysts-2242211 |website=TODAY |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> and that Tan's smear campaigning brought doubt on his being worthy of standing as a candidate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tan Kin Lian's 'pretty girls' posts ignite debate about objectifying women, assessment of presidential candidates |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tan-kin-lian-pretty-girls-women-presidential-election-character-3716156 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref> He also stressed that the relationship between general and presidential elections is "conflated" and that can affect democracy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential candidates have tried to establish their 'independence' to varying degrees of success: Analysts |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-2023-independence-analysts-ng-kok-song-tharman-tan-kin-lian-3729611 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

In a radio interview on MONEY FM 89.3, on "Breakfast with Lynlee Foo and Ryan Huang" on 30 August, Eugene Tan praised the widespread use of social media to communicate in the election.<ref>{{cite web |title=Singapore PE2023: Analysis of Candidate Track Records, Campaign Symbols and Voter Expectations | website=[[YouTube]] | date=30 August 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nNQdkz4sKl4 |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

===After the release of election results===
When the sample counts were released on 2 September, political analysts suggested that Tharman's personal charisma and past track record and experience, including his constituency of [[Jurong GRC]] being the best-performing constituency for two consecutive elections in 2015 and 2020, may have attributed to a landslide victory, as opposed to Ng's lack of public exposure and Tan's previous controversies, which to [[Eugene Tan]], cited in the [[CNA (TV network)|CNA]] Polling Day results special, was a "mind-boggling" result. Eugene Tan also highlighted Tan's relationship with opposition parties, stating that Tan had "too [many] oppositional forces [involved in] his candidacy". In addition, Tan's campaign had a misconception of what the president did as well as expressing views that were perceived as "misogynist, racist, [and] even nativist", which a majority of Singaporeans overwhelmingly rejected.<ref name="CNA-6">{{cite web |title='Rather unexpected': Analysts surprised at Tharman's margin of victory in Singapore Presidential Election |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/presidential-election-results-analysts-tharman-huge-margin-unexpected-ng-kok-song-tan-kin-lian-3741236 |access-date=2 September 2023 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref>

Eugene Tan also noted that the slight decline in turnout and an increase in spoilt votes meant that the election "generally [did] not make much of a difference" and was an effort at a "protest vote". He added that "the drop would be rather significant as this would signal that there might still be those who have some concerns with how the Presidential Election was run". During the [[2011 Singaporean presidential election|2011 presidential election]], turnout was 94.80% (of which 1.79% or 37,849 votes were rejected), while during the 2023 presidential election, turnout was 93.41% (of which 1.98% or 50,152 votes were rejected).<ref name="CNA-6" /><ref name="Fang-2023" />

The reactions of other political analysts to the election results varied, such as NTU political analyst Dr Felix Tan saying that it was "rather unexpected and it's quite a surprise", and emphasising that "establishment versus anti-establishment" might have attributed to the anticlimactic result; and NUS Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian criticising the result, stating that what Tharman had was a huge advantage against "two weak opponents" and feeling that the result was to elect "strong candidates like everyone else". Chong highlighted the short campaigning period of just nine days, as well as Tan's "negative spillover effect" onto opposition supporters, as contributing to both Tan's and Ng's respective decisive defeats.<ref name="CNA-6" />

Following the election, Gillian Koh thought that the landslide was the result of the "Tharman effect", a term which was coined during the 45th [[St. Gallen Symposium]], in 2015, where Tharman was one of the participants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.symposium.org/~/media/ISC/Files/Download/Speakers%20at%20the%2045th%20St%20%20Gallen%20Symposium.ashx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112603/http://www.symposium.org/~/media/ISC/Files/Download/Speakers%20at%20the%2045th%20St%20%20Gallen%20Symposium.ashx |archive-date=2015-09-24 |date=7{{ndash}}8 May 2015 |title=Faculty |language=en |access-date=12 July 2023}}</ref> Tharman's campaign was acclaimed by several analysts. Eugene Tan pointed out that Tharman's slogan, "race is never absent, but it is not the only factor", would be seen as signifying an evolution of the nation, praised the voters for voting for the merits of his personal qualities and track record, and praised the PAP government for promoting "multiracial meritocracy". In another interview, on the ''[[Mothership (website)|Mothership]]'' website, Eugene Tan said that "Singaporean voters are sophisticated" and that they have treated the presidential election as it is and not as "a proxy general election or a referendum on the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP)". In answer to a question on how the result will be an indication of the [[2025 Singaporean general election|next general election]], he warned that the PAP should not treat this result as the "ground being sweet", reminding that parliamentary elections are different, as they are elections between parties rather than individuals.<ref>{{cite web |title=LOTS of Questions with Assoc Prof. Eugene Tan | website=[[YouTube]] | date=2 September 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXggwA4XMMM |access-date=3 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Heart of the Matter - Presidential Election: What do voters think about politics in Singapore? |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/listen/heart-matter/presidential-election-what-do-voters-think-about-politics-singapore-3747306 |website=CNA |access-date=31 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

Leong Chan-Hoong also praised Singaporeans over the results, agreeing that they have voted "about trust of the candidate", over certain doubts and past issues pertaining to the scandals and [[List of resignations from government|resignations]] from the PAP government prior to the election.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tharman rode on his popularity going into election, had 2 'relatively weak opponents': Analysts |url=https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/landslide-win-due-tharman-effect-voters-did-not-treat-election-referendum-pap-analysts-president-elect |website=AsiaOne |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en |date=2 September 2023}}</ref> However, Ng's mention of the "ownself check ownself system" which had been borrowed from opposition parties – specifically from [[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]] of the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (WP) who first coined the term back in 2011 – also raised concerns, citing that it was "very difficult for someone to set up the system to question the system". Analysts implied that voters should also understand the importance of the authority of the president, in addition to the "bread-and-butter issues".<ref>{{cite web |title=Commentary: Tharman's presidential win a triumph for multiracial meritocracy in Singapore, with more to come |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/presidential-election-2023-tharman-shanmugaratnam-polling-day-3741201 |website=CNA |access-date=2 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Singapore Management University]] visiting professor Lee Kong Chian, and former [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] and Legal Adviser to the President and Council of Presidential Advisers [[Walter Woon]] said that, in an election like this, the [[first-past-the-post system]] only really works when there are two contenders, and that [[walkover|no-contest]] elections are bad; but that having too many contenders could also be undesirable.<ref>{{cite web |title=No-contest elections are bad, but too many contenders could also be undesirable: Walter Woon |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/06/presidential-elections-too-many-contenders/ |website=Mothership.sg |access-date=5 September 2023}}</ref> He also said that party politics are inevitable, but they are not necessarily decisive. He added that pundits who could predict the trend of Tharman's clear mandate should "take nothing for granted", and that the victory was an unusual one for a multi-candidate contest, which hints at the possibility that there is another establishment candidate who will be able to repeat this feat against a more formidable opponent in future presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |title=PE2023 offers 4 lessons on eligibility, discretion, politicisation, & unpredictability: Walter Woon |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/pe2023-4-lessons-walter-woon/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=5 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

According to journalists at ''[[The Straits Times]]'' (ST), in a podcast on 4 September, a "contextualized" traditional campaigning is still effective and voters must be prepared to adapt to such scenarios. In another podcast, with ST's multimedia correspondent Hairianto Diman and deputy news editor Grace Ho, it was pointed out that the election would be seen as determining who would represent in a global-level and the generational changes ahead for the government.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ho |first1=Grace |last2=Liang |first2=Lim Yan |last3=Tan |first3=Judith |last4=Yufeng |first4=Kok |last5=Iau |first5=Jean |title=ST Podcast: Traditional campaigning still works, says ST team covering PE2023 |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/st-podcast-traditional-campaigning-still-works-says-st-team-covering-pe2023 |website=The Straits Times |access-date=6 September 2023 |language=en |date=4 September 2023}}</ref>

In commentary published on [[CNA (TV network)|CNA]]'s website, former newspaper editor Han Fook Kwang wrote that the election results are politically significant, as the large margin of victory Tharman enjoyed undermines a claim previously made by members of the Singaporean government that older Singaporeans are not ready to accept a non-Chinese as prime minister.<ref name="HFK-PE2023"/> The results were also seen as undermining an argument for a PAP race-related policy that culminated in the enactment of the hiatus-triggered model for presidential elections (in the case for [[2017 Singaporean presidential election|2017]]), where candidacies in certain presidential elections are reserved for people of certain minority races.<ref name="TW-PE2023"/>

In an article posted on ''Mothership'', editor Sulaiman Daud commented that Tharman's high probability of winning did not make this election "a charade",<ref>{{cite web |title=Comment: Tharman's high likelihood of winning doesn't make the presidential election a charade |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/06/comment-tharmans-high-likelihood-of-winning-doesnt-make-the-presidential-election-a-charade/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref> but cited Tharman's slogans of "hard carry" and "October Surprise" as contributing to his decisive win. Daud also weighed other factors, such as the competition between the other two rivals, or what Singaporeans want in its next President.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comment: Tharman is S'pore's most popular elected president ever. How did he do it? |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/comment-tharman-win-how/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref> Another editor, Tan Min-Wei, also praised the contests and how the election went smoothly, citing a quote from a 1999 American [[political drama]] ''[[The West Wing]]'' that "decisions are made by those who show up".<ref>{{cite web |title=Comment: Lost but not wasted; a thank you to PE2023's unsuccessful contenders |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/pe2023-contender-appreciation/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref> [[Republic Polytechnic]] chairman and chief executive officer of Economic Development Innovations Abel Ang said that people like Tharman believed that people lacking common experiences are "unhealthy for Singapore", and that the life of the haves is increasingly looking different from those who have-not. He also referenced a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' song "The People In Your Neighborhood", one of his favourite songs, as encouraging unity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comment: Tharman aims to be a unifying figure, but unity in S'pore starts in our neighbourhoods |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/tharman-unifying-figure-neighbourhoods/ |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref>

==Inauguration==
Tharman Shanmugratanam's inauguration took place at [[The Istana]] on Thursday, 14 September 2023, at around 19:40, marking the start of his six-year term as [[President of Singapore]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tharman to be inaugurated as S'pore's 9th president on Sep. 14, 2023 |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/tharman-inauguration-when/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref> Similar to preceding presidents after [[Benjamin Sheares]], Tharman said he would not be residing at The Istana so that he would remain actively involved with Singaporeans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Incoming President Tharman will not be moving to the Istana |url=https://mothership.sg/2023/09/tharman-not-moving-to-istana/ |website=mothership.sg |access-date=12 September 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tharman Shanmugaratnam sworn in as Singapore's ninth President |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tharman-shanmugaratnam-inauguration-singapore-president-3763676 |website=CNA |access-date=15 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] gave a speech where he said that the election meant the voters had said that the "race is a smaller factor now" and Tharman's election was "on his merits, by an overwhelming majority". Lee added that he respected Tharman's "long and distinguished" career and would look forward for their cooperation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Singaporeans have chosen a President who is 'eminently qualified': PM Lee |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-president-tharman-shanmugaratnam-inauguration-3770396?cid=telegram_cna_social_28112017_cna |website=CNA |access-date=15 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> In Tharman's inauguration speech, he swore to be "scrupulous and independent" in fulfilling his presidential role and to carry out the president's custodial powers. He also promised to unify Singapore, to "make us a better society, and add to our ballast as we face a more turbulent world", citing "we only truly succeed when we succeed together". The president being an international diplomat, his maintaining Singapore's principles—in the wake of the current economic trends, the [[China–United States relations]], and the ongoing [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]—was important. He again mentioned that "we must not allow any of our differences to divide us" and again reminded people that Singapore must make sure that "[[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]] would not be Singapore's last crisis". The inauguration was witnessed by all cabinet ministers (except [[S Iswaran]]), emeritus [[Senior Minister of Singapore|Senior Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]], and former president [[Tony Tan]], along with their spouses;<ref>{{cite web |title=President Tharman vows to be 'scrupulous and independent' in decisions on reserves |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-president-tharman-shanmugaratnam-inauguration-speech-scrupulous-independent-reserves-3770341 |website=CNA |access-date=15 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Lee's wife [[Ho Ching]] was absent on that day.<ref>{{cite web |title=In pictures: Inauguration of Singapore's new President Tharman Shanmugaratnam |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/inauguration-singapore-new-president-tharman-shanmugaratnam-3770896 |website=CNA |access-date=15 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref>
