Indirect presidential elections were held in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on 20 January 2023.<ref>[https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20221227/trinidad-tobago-elect-new-president-jan-20 Trinidad & Tobago to elect new president Jan 20]</ref>

== Context ==
On 5 January 2018, the name of [[Paula-Mae Weekes]], a judge of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] Court of Appeal, was put forward by the [[People's National Movement|PNM]] government of [[Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago|Prime Minister]] [[Keith Rowley]] in hopes of reaching a consensus with the [[United National Congress|UNC]]-led parliamentary opposition of [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], which later indeed endorsed her nomination as well. As Weekes was the only nominated candidate on election day, she was deemed elected without the need for a vote. Paula-Mae Weeks thus became the [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government|first woman]] to take office as president of Trinidad and Tobago on 19 March 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20180105/news/pms-wise-choice |title=Trinidad Express Newspapers: News &#124; PM's WISE CHOICE |accessdate=2018-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061126/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20180105/news/pms-wise-choice |archivedate=7 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[People's National Movement|PNM]] government nominated [[Christine Kangaloo]], the [[President of the Senate of Trinidad and Tobago|President of the Senate]]. The opposition [[United National Congress|UNC]] declined to endorse her candidacy on the grounds that she was an active member of the government party and so have nominated their own candidate, Israel Raja-Khan.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2023-01-07|title=She's a PNM politician|url=https://trinidadexpress.com/news/local/she-s-a-pnm-politician/article_cbdf816c-8e2f-11ed-9f12-1bffc6c051d6.html|website=[[Trinidad Express Newspapers|Trinidad Express]]|language=en-US}}</ref> It's the first time in more than two decades that a presidential election took place without a consensus candidate.

==Electoral method==
The [[President of Trinidad and Tobago]] is indirectly elected for a 5-year term by an [[electoral college]] comprising all 41 members of the [[House of Representatives (Trinidad and Tobago)|House of Representatives]] and all 31 members of the [[Senate (Trinidad and Tobago)|Senate]], plus the speakers of both chambers.

To win the election a candidate must gain a plurality of votes cast, whereby a quorum comprising the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 10 Senators and 12 other member of the House of Representatives must be met for the election to be considered valid. If only one candidate should be nominated to run in the election, he or she shall be considered to have been elected president without the need for a vote to take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/mesicic3_tto_constitution.pdf|title=Laws of Trinidad and Tobago|website=oas.org|access-date=21 March 2023}}</ref>
