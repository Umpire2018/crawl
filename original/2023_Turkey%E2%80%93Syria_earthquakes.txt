On 6 February 2023, at 04:17&nbsp;[[Time in Turkey|TRT]] (01:17&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), a {{M|w|link=y}}&nbsp;7.8 earthquake struck southern and central [[Turkey]] and northern and western [[Syria]]. The [[epicenter]] was {{cvt|37|km}} west–northwest of [[Gaziantep]].<ref name="anss7.8" /> The earthquake had a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of XII (''Extreme'') around the epicenter and in [[Antakya]]. It was followed by a {{M|w}}7.7 earthquake at 13:24.<ref name="gcmt" /> This earthquake was centered {{cvt|95|km}} north-northeast from the first. There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities.

The {{M|w}}7.8 earthquake is the largest in Turkey since the [[1939 Erzincan earthquake]] of the same magnitude, and jointly the second-largest in the country, after larger estimates for the [[1668 North Anatolia earthquake]]. It is also one of the [[List of earthquakes in the Levant|strongest earthquakes ever recorded in the Levant]]. It was felt as far as Egypt<!-- DO NOT LINK, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance --> and the [[Black Sea]] coast of Turkey. There were more than [[List of aftershocks of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|30,000 aftershocks]] in the three months that followed. The seismic sequence was the result of shallow [[strike-slip]] faulting along segments of the Dead Sea Transform, East Anatolian and Sürgü–Çardak faults.

There was widespread damage in an area of about {{cvt|350000|km2}}, about the size of Germany.<ref>{{cite news|last1=England|first1=Andrew|last2=Smith|first2=Alan|last3=Parrish|first3=Graham|last4=Bernard|first4=Steven|title=Turkey and Syria's devastating earthquakes in graphics|url=https://www.ft.com/content/337edef6-05c9-498c-a3f0-13776082f218|access-date=24 February 2023|work=Financial Times|location=London|date=9 February 2023|archive-date=30 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230430212632/https://www.ft.com/content/337edef6-05c9-498c-a3f0-13776082f218|url-status=live}}</ref> An estimated 14 million people, or 16 percent of Turkey's population, were affected.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parkinson|first1=Joe|last2=Hinshaw|first2=Drew|last3=Grove|first3=Thomas|title=After Turkey's Earthquake Comes the Reckoning.

[[File:Anatolian Plate Vectoral.svg|lang=en|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Anatolian sub-plate]], showing the location of the [[East Anatolian Fault]]]]
Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]: the [[African plate]], [[Arabian plate]], and [[Anatolian sub-plate]]. The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is represented by the [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST)—a major zone of left-lateral [[strike-slip]] fault—it accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa. The northern end of the DST truncates at the [[East Anatolian Fault]] (EAF), another major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian plate. The DST and EAF meet at the [[Marash triple junction]]. The EAF continues west of the [[triple junction]], forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the [[Cyprus arc]] to the west via the [[Latakia Ridge]].<ref name="Duman_&_Emre_2013"/>

The {{cvt|700|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} EAF is subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast; the [[Karlıova]], Ilıca, [[Palu, Elazığ|Palu]], [[Pütürge]], Erkenek, [[Pazarcık]] and [[Amanos]] segments.<ref name="Duman_&_Emre_2013">{{Cite book|last1=Duman|first1=T.Y.|title=Geological Development of Anatolia and the Easternmost Mediterranean Region|last2=Emre|first2=Ö|publisher=Geological Society|year=2013|isbn=9781862393530|editor-last=Robertson|editor-first=A.H.F.|series=Special Publications|publication-place=London|chapter=The East Anatolian Fault: geometry, segmentation and jog characteristics|doi=10.1144/SP372.14|bibcode=2013GSLSP.372..495D|s2cid=129225180|editor-last2=Parlak|editor-first2=O|editor-last3=Ünlügenç|editor-first3=U.C.}}</ref> The Amanos segment is also considered [[Dead Sea Transform#Karasu fault|part of the DST]] by some geologists,<ref name="Tari_etal_2014">{{Cite journal|last1=Tarı|first1=U.|last2=Tüysüz|first2=O.|last3=Genç|first3=Ş.C.|last4=Imren|first4=C.|last5=Blackwell|first5=B.A.B.|last6=Lom|first6=N.|last7=Tekeşin|first7=Ö|last8=Üsküplü|first8=S.|last9=Altıok|first9=S. |last10=Beyhan |first10=M.|year=2014|title=The geology and morphology of the Antakya Graben between the Amik Triple Junction and the Cyprus Arc|journal=Geodinimica Acta|volume=26|issue=1–2|pages=27–55|doi=10.1080/09853111.2013.858962|s2cid=128404168}}</ref> or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others.<ref name="Elhadidy_etal_2021">{{Cite journal|last1=Elhadidy|first1=M.|last2=Abdalzaher|first2=M.S.|last3=Gaber|first3=H.|year=2021|title=Up-to-date PSHA along the Gulf of Aqaba-Dead Sea transform fault|journal=Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering|volume=148|page=106835|doi=10.1016/j.soildyn.2021.106835|bibcode=2021SDEE..14806835E}}</ref> A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognized, including the Sürgü, Çardak, Savrun, Çokak, Toprakkale, Yumurtalık, Karataş, Yakapınar and Düziçi–İskenderun segments.

The northern part of the DST is subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between scientists as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure.

===Geological effects===
[[File:A heavily damaged building in Gölbaşı after 7,8 magnitude earthquake in Turkiye.jpg|thumb|An example of [[soil liquefaction]] and a partially tilted apartment building in Gölbaşı]]
[[Soil liquefaction|Liquefaction]] was identified via satellite and [[remote sensing]] along the southern portion of the {{M|w}}7.8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Gölbaşı. Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by [[Holocene]] [[Sedimentary structures|sediments]].{{sfn|Taftsoglou|Valkaniotis|Karantanellis|Goula|pp=8|2023}} These effects were widespread in the [[Amik Valley]] and [[Orontes River]] plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province. Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.{{sfn|Taftsoglou|Valkaniotis|Karantanellis|Goula|pp=8|2023}} Liquefaction was also observed in [[Samandağ]]. At Lake Gölbaşı, Adıyaman Province, lateral spreading occurred along the northern, eastern and southern coast. Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged. [[Gölbaşı, Adıyaman|Gölbaşı]] was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.{{sfn|Taftsoglou|Valkaniotis|Karantanellis|Goula|pp=12|2023}}

[[File:Coastal flooding after 7,8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey.jpg|256px|thumb|left|Subsidence at Lake Gölbaşı from lateral spreading lead to floods along the shore]]

Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in İskenderun. Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atatürk Boulevard in Çay District. Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes. Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure.{{sfn|Çen|Bray|Frost|Hortacsu|2023|pp=112–143}} The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as {{cvt|200|m}}. Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading. Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at İskenderun.<ref name="Ravilious1">{{cite news|last1=Ravilious|first1=K.|title=Geological impact of Turkey-Syria earthquake slowly comes into focus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/10/geological-impact-of-turkey-syria-earthquake-slowly-comes-into-focus|access-date=11 February 2023|work=The Guardian|date=10 February 2023|archive-date=23 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230223093415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/10/geological-impact-of-turkey-syria-earthquake-slowly-comes-into-focus|url-status=live}}</ref>

Both earthquakes caused shaking levels (≥0.12 ''g'') sufficient for landslide-triggering across a {{cvt|90,000|km2}} area. About 3,673 earthquake-triggered landslides were identified using satellite imagery, aerial photos, and one field survey of the area. Landslides mainly occurred in the northern region of the affected area. Rockslides were the most commonly observed; there were also many bedrock rotational landslides, translational slides and lateral spreads. Surface ruptures propagating through hillsides also triggered landslides.

The largest wave measured {{cvt|40|cm}} along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Although no underwater surveys results have been made available to identify the sources of these tsunamis, they were likely produced by landsliding at Iskenderun Port and liquefaction on the coastal flatlands of Antakya.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Gui|last2=Satake|first2=Kenji|last3=Li|first3=Linlin|last4=Du|first4=Peng|title=Origins of the Tsunami Following the 2023 Turkey–Syria Earthquake|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|year=2023|volume=50|issue=18|doi=10.1029/2023GL103997|bibcode=2023GeoRL..5003997H|s2cid=262187921|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Effects on other faults===
The earthquake rupture terminated near Suvatlı in the [[Amik Valley]], where some {{cvt|10.5|km}} to its east is the Hacıpaşa Fault, a Dead Sea Transform segment. The rupture was arrested by a [[Strike-slip tectonics#Stepovers|stepover]] that connects the East Anatolian Fault with the Hacıpaşa Fault. Though it did not rupture, the Coulomb stress increased on the Hacıpaşa Fault. With a combination of the increases stress, 600–900 years without major earthquakes, and an annual slip rate of {{cvt|5|mm}}, it is a potential source of magnitude 7.0 or greater earthquakes. The accumulated slip along this segment is estimated at {{cvt|3–9|m}}. An earthquake "domino effect" remains plausible along the Dead Sea Transform beginning with the Hacıpaşa Fault, as observed along the North Anatolian Fault, where successive earthquakes have migrated westwards along the fault since 1939.<ref name="Altunel24">{{cite journal|last1=Altunel|first1=Erhan|last2=Kozacı|first2=Özgür|last3=Yıldırım|first3=Cengiz|last4=Sbeinati|first4=Reda Mohamed|last5=Meghraoui|first5=Mustapha|title=Potential domino effect of the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake on the centuries-long seismic quiescence of the Dead Sea fault: inferences from the North Anatolian fault|journal=Scientific Reports|year=2024|volume=14|issue=15440|page=15440|doi=10.1038/s41598-024-65906-4|pmid=38965261|pmc=11224342}}</ref>

An engineer revealed to the newspaper; "the building violated the basic tenets of engineering," after inspecting its blueprints. Contractors of the building said they adhered to building regulations but those were not enough against the earthquake.<ref name="Hubbard24-1">{{cite news|last1=Hubbard|first1=Ben|last2=Singhvi|first2=Anjali|last3=Glanz|first3=James|last4=Gröndahl|first4=Mika|last5=Ince|first5=Elif|last6=Eski|first6=Beril|last7=Timur|first7=Safak|title=Why One Upscale Apartment Building Became a Death Trap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/11/world/europe/turkey-earthquake-apartment-building-collapse.html|access-date=8 May 2024|work=The New York Times|date=11 May 2023}}</ref>

The 13-storey apartment block consists of three closely spaced buildings linked externally, but not structurally; when the collapse occurred, all three buildings separated. The basement, two-storey parking space was considered the "strongest part" of the complex as it had more concrete walls than other parts of the structure. The building's exterior walls and those that separated units and rooms consisted of heavy masonry which may have prevented the structure from swaying and possibly held the building mostly intact despite toppling. The building was considered a [[Soft story building|soft story structure]] as the ground floor had fewer masonry walls which meant it was at greater risk of damage from [[strong ground motion|seismic ground motion]]. Among other factors were that the core concrete columns which housed the elevator systems were situated along the north side which left the south side vulnerable without adequate support. Another reason was that beams emerging from either side of the building were misaligned and did not connect to each other. These features may have contributed to the building overturning onto its south side.<ref name="Hubbard24-1" />
