In the first round Erdoğan and Oğan outperformed expectations to receive 49.5% and 5.2% of the vote respectively, while Kılıçdaroğlu received 44.9% and Muharrem İnce (who remained on the ballot despite withdrawing) 0.4%.

==Background==
===2018 elections===
{{main|2018 Turkish general election}}

The [[2018 Turkish presidential election|previous Turkish general election]] took place on 24 June 2018. The election marked the country's transition from a [[parliamentarism|parliamentary system]] to a [[presidential system|presidential one]], as narrowly endorsed by voters in the controversial [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017 constitutional referendum]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Chris |title=Turkey elections: How powerful will the next Turkish president be? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44574919 |access-date=31 May 2023 |work=BBC |date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327191519/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44574919 |archive-date=27 March 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Erdoğan clinches victory in Turkish constitutional referendum |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/16/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-constitutional-referendum |access-date=31 May 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=16 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206105433/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/16/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-constitutional-referendum |archive-date=6 February 2023|url-status=live|location=Ankara}}</ref> That election resulted in a victory for incumbent president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], who had held the position since 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=Turkey election: Erdogan win ushers in new presidential era |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44601383 |access-date=31 May 2023 |work=BBC |date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323133400/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44601383 |archive-date=23 March 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) lost its absolute majority in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] for the first time since [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015]], forcing it to rely on its coalition partner, the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP) of [[Devlet Bahçeli]], to pass legislation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Erdogan wins elections for Presidency of Turkey while his AK Party loses parliamentary majority: The struggle continues |url=https://www.liberationnews.org/erdogan-wins-elections-for-presidency-of-turkey-while-his-akp-loses-majority/ |access-date=31 May 2023 |work=Liberation News |date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123181444/https://www.liberationnews.org/erdogan-wins-elections-for-presidency-of-turkey-while-his-akp-loses-majority/ |archive-date=23 January 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Date==
The regular scheduled date for the first round of the elections was set for 18 June 2023. However, the electoral system allowed for moving the date forward. In 2020, there was speculation about a snap election prior to the regular one in 2023. At the time, [[Devlet Bahçeli]], the leader of coalition partner [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], ruled them out. In a written statement, he said that elections would not be held before 2023. He also confirmed that the current coalition between AKP and MHP will remain intact and [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] will be their [[2023 Recep Tayyip Erdoğan presidential campaign|joint nominee for President]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Devlet Bahçeli: 2023 yılında cumhurbaşkanı adayımız Erdoğan |url=https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5n4vved6mo.amp |access-date=31 May 2023 |work=BBC News |date=18 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221231095511/https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/cz5n4vved6mo.amp |archive-date=31 December 2022|url-status=live|language=tr}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The [[President of Turkey]] is directly elected through the [[two-round system]], under which a candidate must obtain a [[Majority|simple majority]] (more than 50%) of the popular vote to be elected. If no candidate secures an overall majority outright, then a runoff is held between the two most voted-for candidates from the first round, the winner of which is then declared elected. The first direct election to the Turkish presidency was held in 2014, after [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|a referendum in 2007]] abolished the previous system under which the head of state was elected by the legislature chamber, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].

* The first four articles of our Constitution and the definition and content of Turkish Citizenship in Article 66 will be preserved.
* The national-unitary-secular state established in 1924 will never be compromised.
* All asylum seekers and fugitives, especially Syrians, will be sent back to their countries within one year at the latest.
* All terrorist organizations targeting the existence and integrity of the state, especially FETÖ, PKK and ISIS, will be fought effectively and decisively. Within the framework of the fight against terrorism, the practice of appointing state officials instead of local administrators whose links with terrorism are proven by legal evidence will continue within the framework of judicial decision. Terrorism will be fought, not negotiated. No political and legal arrangements targeting the national and unitary state structure of Turkey will be allowed.
* In assignments to be made in all units of the state, it will be ensured that merit, not loyalty, is the basis.
* All corruption will be dealt with very effectively within the framework of the law.
* It is fully agreed that the state should be transparent and open to its citizens.
