The '''2023 United States banking crisis''' was a series of bank failures and bankruptcies that took place in early 2023, with the [[United States federal government]] ultimately intervening in several ways.  Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small-to-mid size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global [[financial contagion|contagion]]. [[Silicon Valley Bank]] (SVB) failed when a [[bank run]] was triggered after it sold its [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bond|Treasury bond]] portfolio at a large loss, causing depositor concerns about the bank's [[liquidity]]. The bonds had lost significant value as market interest rates rose after the bank had shifted its portfolio to longer-maturity bonds. The bank's clientele was primarily technology companies and wealthy individuals holding large deposits, but balances exceeding $250,000 were not insured by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). [[Silvergate Bank]] and [[Signature Bank]], both with significant exposure to [[cryptocurrency]], failed in the midst of [[Cryptocurrency bubble#2021–2023 crash|turbulence in that market]].

In response to the bank failures, the three major U.S. federal bank regulators announced in a joint [[communiqué]] that extraordinary measures would be taken to ensure that all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would be honored.<ref name=":1">{{cite news |date=March 12, 2023 |title=Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC |work=[[Federal Reserve]] |agency= |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm |url-status=live |access-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312222042/https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm |archive-date=March 12, 2023}}</ref> The [[Federal Reserve]] established a [[Bank Term Funding Program]] (BTFP) to offer loans of up to one year to eligible [[depository institution]]s pledging qualifying assets as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]].<ref name=":11">{{Cite news |date=March 12, 2023 |title=Federal Reserve Board announces it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors |work=[[Federal Reserve]] |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm |access-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312230737/https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm |url-status=live }} {{PD-inline}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite news |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff |last2=Lynch |first2=David J. |last3=Romm |first3=Tony |last4=Pager |first4=Tyler |date=March 12, 2023 |title=U.S. says 'all' deposits at failed bank will be available Monday |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2023/03/12/silicon-valley-bank-deposits/ |access-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312203203/https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2023/03/12/silicon-valley-bank-deposits/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Soon after the bank run at SVB, depositors quickly began withdrawing cash from San Francisco-based [[First Republic Bank]] (FRB), which focused on [[private banking]] to wealthy clientele. Like SVB, FRB had substantial uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000; such deposits constituted 68% of the bank's total at year-end 2022, declining to 27% by the end of March, as $100 billion in uninsured deposits were withdrawn. Despite a $30 billion capital infusion from a group of major banks in March, FRB continued to destabilize and its stock price plummeted as the FDIC prepared to take it into receivership and find a buyer on April 29.<ref name=":6">{{cite news |last1=Isidore |first1=Chris |title=What's next for troubled First Republic Bank |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/business/first-republic-whats-next/index.html |access-date=30 April 2023 |work=[[CNN]] |date=29 April 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":17">{{cite news |last1=Son |first1=Hugh |title=Big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America asked for final bids on First Republic |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/29/first-republic-frc-jpmorgan-chase-bank-of-america-asked-for-bids.html |access-date=30 April 2023 |work=[[CNBC]] |date=29 April 2023 |language=en}}</ref> On May 1, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]] announced that First Republic had been closed and sold to [[JPMorgan Chase]].<ref name="NYTimesSeized">{{cite news |last1=Farrell |first1=Maureen |last2=Smialek |first2=Jeanna |last3=Hirsch |first3=Lauren |title=First Republic Bank Is Seized by Regulators and Sold to JPMorgan Chase |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-bank-jpmorgan.html |access-date=1 May 2023 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 May 2023}}</ref><ref name="FDICPressRelease">{{cite web |title=JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio Assumes All the Deposits of First Republic Bank, San Francisco, California |url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23034.html |website=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]] |access-date=1 May 2023 |date=1 May 2023}}</ref>

In the lead-up period, many banks within the United States had invested their reserves in [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]], which had been paying [[Zero interest-rate policy|low interest rates]] for several years. As the [[Federal Reserve]] began raising interest rates in 2022 in response to the [[2021–2023 inflation surge|2021–2022 inflation surge]], bond prices declined, decreasing the market value of [[Bank reserves|bank capital reserves]], causing some banks to incur unrealized losses; to maintain liquidity, Silicon Valley Bank sold its bonds to realize  steep losses.<ref name=wsj20230316 /> Also, several banks gained [[market exposure]] to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-related firms prior to and during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]];<ref>{{Cite news |last=DiCamilio |first=Nate |date=March 1, 2023 |title=How much exposure do global banks have to crypto? |work=[[Quartz (magazine)|Quartz]] |url=https://qz.com/new-report-reveals-global-bank-crypto-exposure-1850173608 |access-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-date=March 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307213825/https://qz.com/new-report-reveals-global-bank-crypto-exposure-1850173608 |url-status=live }}</ref> the 2020–2022 cryptocurrency bubble [[cryptocurrency bubble#2020–2022 cryptocurrency bubble|popped in late 2022]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Julian |last2=Gerrit |first1=Mark |first2=De Vynck |date=17 December 2022 |title='Crypto winter' has come.

==Liquidation of Silvergate Bank==
{{Further|Silvergate Bank#Liquidation}}

===Background===
[[Silvergate Bank]] was a California-based bank that began operations in 1988 as a [[savings and loan association]]. In the 2010s, the bank began to provide banking services to players within the [[cryptocurrency]] market. The bank sought regulatory approval in the summer of 2014 to do business with cryptocurrency firms. The bank expanded the assets on its balance sheet significantly—doubling its assets in its 2017 fiscal year to $1.9 billion—by servicing [[cryptocurrency exchange]]s and other companies who were involved in the cryptocurrency business that could not secure financing from larger, more conservative banks. Despite its rapid growth, the company maintained a small physical footprint; {{As of|2018|alt=in 2018}}, the bank had only three branches, all located in [[Southern California]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite news |first1=Kate |last1=Rooney |last2=Cheng |first2=Evelyn |date=May 31, 2018 |title=Meet the small community lender that's become the go-to banker of the cryptocurrency world |work=[[CNBC]] |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/meet-silvergates-alan-lane-whos-bankrolling-cryptocurrency-exchanges.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309161353/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/meet-silvergates-alan-lane-whos-bankrolling-cryptocurrency-exchanges.html |archive-date=March 9, 2023}}</ref> By the fourth quarter of 2022, 90% of the bank's deposits had become cryptocurrency-related, with over $1 billion in deposits being tied to [[Sam Bankman-Fried]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite news |last=Benoit |first=David |date=January 5, 2023 |title=Silvergate Raced to Cover $8.1 Billion in Withdrawals During Crypto Meltdown |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/silvergate-raced-to-cover-8-1-billion-in-withdrawals-during-crypto-meltdown-11672895207 |access-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312164928/https://www.wsj.com/articles/silvergate-raced-to-cover-8-1-billion-in-withdrawals-during-crypto-meltdown-11672895207 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to providing traditional banking services to its cryptocurrency clients, the bank operated as a [[Clearing house (finance)|clearinghouse]] for its banking clients; it involved itself in the business of resolving and [[Settlement (finance)|settling]] transactions in real-time through its proprietary Silvergate Exchange Network. The network allowed a client to send payments in U.S. dollars from its accounts with Silvergate to those of another client of the bank without requiring an interbank [[wire transfer]]. A large number of cryptocurrency companies set up accounts with the bank to take advantage of Silvergate's relatively quick transaction settling times.<ref name=":3" />

[[File:Silvergate stock price.webp|thumb|260px|[[Silvergate Bank|Silvergate]] stock price (2019–2023)]]
Despite conducting the majority of its business with cryptocurrency companies, Silvergate's [[investment portfolio]] was fairly conservative; the company took large positions in [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] as well as [[U.S. Bonds|U.S. bonds]].<ref name=":5" /> These sorts of assets, while reliable to be paid-in-full through their [[maturity date]], carry risks associated with changes in [[interest rate]]s; there is an inverse relationship between the [[Mark-to-market accounting|mark-to-market]] value of a bond and the [[Yield (finance)|bond's yield]]. As interest rates shot up during the [[2021–2023 inflation surge]], the mark-to-market price of these securities decreased significantly. When these losses are [[revenue recognition|unrealized]], this does not typically cause the bank to cease operating, as the bank will receive payment-in-full under the original terms of the bond. However, if forced to sell these securities at a lower mark-to-market price, the losses on these types of assets become [[Realization (finance)|realized]], posing significant risks to the bank's ability to continue to operate.<ref name=":5" />

===Events===
Silvergate was hit with a [[bank run]] in the wake of the [[bankruptcy of FTX]]; deposits from cryptocurrency-related firms dropped by 68% at the bank, with the bank facing requests from its clients to withdraw upwards of $8 billion in deposits.<ref name=":4" /> As Silvergate did not have enough cash-on-hand to satisfy the deposit withdrawals, the bank began to sell its assets at a steep loss; the company realized a loss of $718 million on withdrawal-related asset sales in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 alone.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Forelle |first=Charles |date=January 5, 2023 |title=When 'Held to Maturity' Isn't—and Why That Matters to Silvergate |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-01-05-2023/card/when-held-to-maturity-isn-t-and-why-that-matters-to-silvergate-M3iuQ83zpMGeZLYKQnRv |access-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-date=January 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230105163648/https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-01-05-2023/card/when-held-to-maturity-isn-t-and-why-that-matters-to-silvergate-M3iuQ83zpMGeZLYKQnRv |url-status=live }}</ref> The bank, in a public statement, said that it was solvent at the end of Q4 2022, with an asset sheet containing assets of $4.6 billion in cash and $5.6 billion in liquid debt securities, with $3.8 billion in deposit obligations.<ref name=":4" /> Silvergate faced tight financial constraints in the coming months, selling assets at a loss and borrowing $3.6 billion from the [[Federal Home Loan Banks|Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco]] to maintain its liquidity.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wallerstein |first=Eric |date=January 21, 2023 |title=Crypto Banks Borrow Billions From Home-Loan Banks to Plug Shortfalls |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-banks-borrow-billions-from-home-loan-banks-to-plug-shortfalls-11674263424?mod=Searchresults_pos11&page=1 |access-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230313145211/https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-banks-borrow-billions-from-home-loan-banks-to-plug-shortfalls-11674263424?mod=Searchresults_pos11&page=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> Silvergate wrote in a regulatory filing on March 1 that the bank risked losing its status as a well-capitalized bank and that the bank faced risks relating to its ability to continue operating.<ref name=wsj20230308/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Grant |first=Charley |date=March 1, 2023 |title=Silvergate Stock Drops After Filing Raises Questions About Its Ability to Stay in Business |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-03-01-2023/card/crypto-bank-silvergate-s-stock-sells-off-sharply-on-late-annual-report-7dItaBqGHOFI6hQjod9b |access-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-date=March 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309000116/https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-03-01-2023/card/crypto-bank-silvergate-s-stock-sells-off-sharply-on-late-annual-report-7dItaBqGHOFI6hQjod9b |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2021, it purchased long-term [[United States Treasury security|Treasury bonds]] to capitalize on the increased deposits.

===Events===
To raise cash to pay withdrawals by its depositors, SVB announced on March 8 that it had sold over US$21 billion worth of securities, borrowed US$15{{nbsp}}billion, and would hold an emergency sale of some of its [[treasury stock]] to raise US$2.25{{nbsp}}billion. The announcement, coupled with warnings from prominent Silicon Valley investors, caused a bank run as customers withdrew funds totaling US$42{{nbsp}}billion by the following day.<ref name="DFPI order" />

On March 10, 2023, as a result of the bank run, the [[California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation]] (DFPI) seized SVB and placed it under the receivership of the FDIC. The FDIC established a [[deposit insurance national bank]], the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, to service insured deposits and announced that it would start paying dividends for uninsured deposits the following week; the dividends were funded by proceeds from the sale of SVB assets. Some 89 percent of the bank's US$172{{nbsp}}billion in deposit liabilities exceeded the maximum insured by the FDIC.<ref name="reuters_fwj">{{Cite news |last1=French |first1=David |last2=Wang

===Government discussion of other funding===
In addition to working with their counterparts at the FDIC and U.S. Treasury to provide liquidity to banks through the BTFP, by March 2023, the Federal Reserve had begun to internally discuss implementing stricter [[Reserve requirement|capital reserve]] and liquidity requirements for banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets on their balance sheets.<ref name=":14">{{Cite news |last=Ackerman |first=Andrew |date=March 14, 2023 |title=Fed to Consider Tougher Rules for Midsize Banks After SVB, Signature Failures |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-consider-tougher-rules-for-midsize-banks-after-svb-signature-failures-4453fe5d |access-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230314234552/https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-consider-tougher-rules-for-midsize-banks-after-svb-signature-failures-4453fe5d |url-status=live }}</ref> A review of regulations affecting regional banks had been ongoing since 2022, as Federal Reserve vice chairman [[Michael Barr (U.S. official)|Michael Barr]] and other officials in the [[Biden Administration]] had become increasingly concerned about the risk posed to the financial system by the rapidly increasing size of regional banks.<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ackerman |first=Andrew |date=September 7, 2022 |title=Fed's Top Banking Regulator Signals Tougher Merger Reviews, 'Living Wills' |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-top-banking-regulator-calls-for-safer-fairer-financial-system-11662573609?mod=article_inline |access-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230314234814/https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-top-banking-regulator-calls-for-safer-fairer-financial-system-11662573609?mod=article_inline |url-status=live }}</ref>

===U.S. investigations===
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank itself also spurred federal investigations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the United States Department of Justice. Within the scope of both probes is the sales of stock made by senior officers of Silicon Valley Bank shortly before the bank failed, while the SEC's investigation also includes a review of past financial-related and other risk-related disclosures made by Silicon Valley Bank to evaluate their accuracy and completeness.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Michaels |first=Dave |date=March 14, 2023 |title=Justice Department, SEC Investigating Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-sec-investigating-silicon-valley-banks-collapse-c192c2b2 |access-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230314232808/https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-sec-investigating-silicon-valley-banks-collapse-c192c2b2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Internal investigations at the FDIC and Federal Reserve noted that deregulation, not subjecting medium-sized banks to high scrutiny, reduced enforcement of remaining regulations, and government staffing shortages weakened oversight and allowed mismanagement of banks to cause their collapse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horsley |first1=Scott |last2=Gura |first2=David |title=A new report assesses last month's bank failures and includes lessons for the future |url=https://www.npr.org/2023/04/28/1172836560/a-new-report-assesses-last-months-bank-failures-and-includes-lessons-for-the-fut |website=[[NPR]] |access-date=1 July 2023 |date=28 April 2023}}</ref>
