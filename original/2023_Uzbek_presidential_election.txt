==Background==

The Uzbekistan legislation requires at least 33% of eligible voters to take part in the presidential elections, otherwise, the elections will be pronounced invalid. The law also provides for a second round if none of the candidates receives more than 50% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-27 |title=Elections in Uzbekistan: 2023 Presidential Elections |url=https://www.ifes.org/tools-resources/election-snapshots/elections-uzbekistan-2023-presidential-elections |access-date=2023-09-05 |website=International Foundation for Electoral Systems |language=en}}</ref> In practice, neither of these events have yet occurred, as every presidential election winner since the country's independence in 1991 has won with over 80% of the vote on a turnout of over 79%, and each incumbent standing for re-election has been re-elected.

==Conduct==
The [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR) said that the elected "lacked genuine political competition despite some efforts to reform."
