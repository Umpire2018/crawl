{{Politics of Austria}}

[[General election|Legislative elections]] were held in [[Austria]] on 29 September 2024 to elect the 28th [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]], the lower house of Austria's bicameral parliament.

The election saw the far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) place first, winning 28.8% of the vote and achieving the best result in the party's history. This was the first time that a [[far-right party]] won the most seats in a legislative election in Austria after World War II.<ref name="Karnitschnig 2024">{{cite news |last=Karnitschnig |first=Matthew |title=Austria goes back to the future as voters embrace far-right party founded by Nazis |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-far-right-freedom-party-win-national-election-early-projections-herbet-kickl/ |newspaper=Politico |department=Europe |date=2024-09-29}}</ref><ref name="Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2024">{{cite news |title=Austria's Freedom Party secures first national election win for far-right since World War II |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/austria-far-right-first-election-win-since-second-world-war/104412948 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |department= |date=2024-09-30}}</ref><ref name="Harris 2024">{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Rob  |title=Austrian far-right party wins first national election since World War II |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/austria-s-first-far-right-national-election-win-since-world-war-2-20240930-p5kefv.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |department=World elections |date=2024-09-30}}</ref> The governing [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) lost 20 seats, while its coalition partner, the [[The Greens (Austria)|Greens]], lost 10 seats. The centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) won just 21.1%, marking its worst result ever in terms of percentages and the place occupied (3rd), but it gained one seat compared to the previous election. [[NEOS (Austria)|NEOS]] slightly improved from 2019, rising from 15 to 18 seats. No other party was able to clear the 4% threshold to win seats.

==Background==
The [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019 legislative election]] was called after the [[Ibiza affair]], which triggered the collapse of the [[coalition government]] between the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) led by Chancellor [[Sebastian Kurz]]. The coalition was ousted in a [[motion of no confidence]] and replaced by a non-partisan interim government.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austrian parliament topples Chancellor Sebastian Kurz |url=https://www.dw.com/en/austrian-parliament-topples-chancellor-sebastian-kurz/a-48904760 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=27 May 2019}}</ref> The election delivered a strong victory for the ÖVP, which rose to 37.5%, while the FPÖ declined to 16%, its worst result since 2008. With 21%, the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) recorded its worst performance in over a century. [[The Greens (Austria)|The Greens]] returned to the National Council after failing to win seats in 2017, achieving its best-ever result with 14%. [[NEOS (Austria)|NEOS]] improved to 8%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austria's far right loses ground as Sebastian Kurz wins landslide |url=https://www.dw.com/en/austrias-far-right-loses-ground-as-sebastian-kurz-wins-landslide/a-50633489 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=30 September 2019}}</ref>

The ÖVP formed a coalition with The Greens, a first on the federal level in Austria. The new government took office in January 2020, with Sebastian Kurz returning as Chancellor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austria: Greens enter government for first time, join Kurz's conservatives |url=https://www.dw.com/en/austria-greens-enter-government-for-first-time-join-kurzs-conservatives/a-51853261 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=1 January 2020}}</ref>

[[Norbert Hofer]] announced his resignation as leader of the Freedom Party in June 2021. He was replaced by parliamentary group leader [[Herbert Kickl]], whose dismissal as interior minister caused the collapse of the ÖVP–FPÖ government in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austria-herbert-kickl-elected-to-lead-far-right-freedom-party/a-57971160|title=Austria: Herbert Kickl elected to lead far-right Freedom Party|date=20 June 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref>

On 6 October 2021 agents of the Central Prosecutorial Agency for Corruption and Economic Affairs (WKStA) raided the Federal Chancellery and the headquarters of the ÖVP as part of a [[Kurz corruption probe|corruption probe]] targeting Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his "inner circle". Prosecutors alleged that, in 2016, Kurz paid bribes to news outlets to publish coverage and opinion polling favourable to himself, the goal of the scheme being to undermine then-ÖVP leader [[Reinhold Mitterlehner]] so that Kurz could take his place.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austrian prosecutors target Kurz in bribery investigation |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/prosecutors-raid-austrian-conservatives-hq-fresh-headache-kurz-2021-10-06/ |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=7 October 2021}}</ref> The Greens threatened to support a [[motion of no confidence]] if Kurz did not step down as Chancellor. He thus announced his resignation on 9 October and was replaced by Foreign Minister [[Alexander Schallenberg]]. However, he was quickly elected faction leader of the ÖVP in the National Council; it was widely understood that he would remain ''de facto'' leader of the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austrian-chancellor-sebastian-kurz-announces-resignation/a-59458714|title=Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announces resignation|date=9 October 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/alexander-schallenberg-sworn-in-as-chancellor-of-austria/a-59469255|title=Alexander Schallenberg sworn in as chancellor of Austria|date=11 October 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref>

On 2 December, Kurz announced he would resign from all offices and retire from politics, citing a desire to focus on his family after becoming a father. Shortly after, Schallenberg announced he would resign as Chancellor in favour of the new ÖVP leader once one had been elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austrian-chancellor-resigns-after-sebastian-kurz-withdraws-from-politics/a-59993547|title=Austrian chancellor resigns after Sebastian Kurz withdraws from politics|date=2 December 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref> On 3 December, Interior Minister [[Karl Nehammer]] was unanimously appointed as leader of the ÖVP by the federal party committee and proposed as Chancellor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austria-karl-nehammer-set-to-become-new-chancellor/a-60006966|title=Austria: Karl Nehammer set to become new chancellor|date=3 December 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref> He was sworn in by President [[Alexander Van der Bellen]] on 6 December.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austria-karl-nehammer-sworn-in-as-new-chancellor/a-60032938|title=Austria: Karl Nehammer sworn in as new chancellor|date=6 December 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref>

Since 2019 numerous new and old minor parties such as [[Team HC Strache – Alliance for Austria]], [[MFG Austria – People Freedom Fundamental Rights]], [[The Beer Party (Austria)|The Beer Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Austria]] received at times considerable support in the [[2020 Viennese state election]], [[2021 Upper Austrian state election]], [[2022 Austrian presidential election]], [[2023 Salzburg state election]] and various local elections, allowing these parties to win seats.

During the first year of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Austria|COVID-19 pandemic]], the ÖVP-Green government enjoyed high support. The government then became deeply unpopular after it passed a mandatory vaccination law, which led to a strong polarization of the population. As a result, and because of large-scale public protests, the mandatory vaccination law (one of few in the world) was later dropped and was never enforced.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

After a series of corruption scandals involving the ÖVP and rising [[inflation]] – such as skyrocketing housing, electricity, fuel and grocery prices – the government parties lost considerable support in 4 subsequent state elections in [[2022 Tyrolean state election|Tyrol]], [[2023 Lower Austrian state election|Lower Austria]], [[2023 Carinthian state election|Carinthia]] and [[2023 Salzburg state election|Salzburg]]. As of May 2023, inflation in Austria was still around 10% and continues to be much higher than the [[Eurozone]] average, at around 7%.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Under Nehammer's leadership, Austria's government implemented a package of measures worth six billion euros ($6.3 billion){{As of?|date=September 2024}} in 2022 aimed at cushioning the blow to households of the rising cost of living.<ref>Francois Murphy (14 June 2022), [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/austria-announces-6-bln-euro-package-address-cost-of-living-crisis-2022-06-14 "Austria announces 6 billion euro package to address cost-of-living crisis"], [[Reuters]].</ref> The measures helped limit poverty, but according to experts increased inflation further.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

On 8 December 2022, Nehammer was the architect of blocking [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]'s access into the [[Schengen Area]]. Nehammer said he first wants the EU to introduce strict border controls at the EU's outer border to limit illegal immigration before the two countries should be allowed to join Schengen.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thelocal.at/20221208/austria-vetoes-bulgaria-and-romania-joining-europes-schengen-area/|date=8 December 2022|title= Austria vetoes Bulgaria and Romania joining Europe's Schengen area|website=[[The Local]]}}</ref>

On 3 June 2023, after years of internal conflicts, intrigues and crossfire, the opposition SPÖ [[2023 Social Democratic Party of Austria leadership election|elected]] a new party leader. The non-binding party membership vote ahead of the binding party congress was won by [[Hans Peter Doskozil]], although by a simple plurality of votes, leaving the door open for a challenge by second-place finisher [[Andreas Babler]] at the party congress. On 23 May 2023, incumbent party leader [[Pamela Rendi-Wagner]] announced that she would not be a candidate at the party congress, after coming in just third in the membership vote and announced her orderly resignation. On 25 May 2023, Rendi-Wagner announced her complete withdrawal from Austrian politics by the end of June, also resigning as a member of the Austrian Parliament. On 3 June 2023, Hans Peter Doskozil was elected as the new party chairman with 53% of the delegates. However, two days later the SPÖ announced that the results had been mixed up in [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheets and that Babler was the actual winner with 53%, thus becoming the new party chairman.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austria's SPÖ party announces Babler as leader after vote mix-up |url=https://www.thelocal.at/20230605/breaking-austrias-spo-party-announces-babler-as-leader-after-vote-mix-up |website=[[The Local]] |date=5 June 2023}}</ref>

The weakness of both the government parties and the SPÖ has allowed the far-right, populist opposition party FPÖ to top the polls during 2023, positioning it to win an Austrian legislative election for the first time, even though it has previously been involved in the [[Ibiza affair]] scandal which caused the 2019 governing coalition to resign.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

According to polls conducted in May 2023, at that time a government led by the FPÖ and with political [[hardline]]r [[Herbert Kickl]] as Chancellor was opposed at that time by about two in three Austrians. Additionally, President [[Alexander Van der Bellen]] has said that he might not swear in a FPÖ-led government with Kickl as Chancellor, but that he remains open to swearing in a more moderate FPÖ Chancellor.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The rise in inflation and in particular the increasingly unaffordable cost of housing saw the [[Communist Party of Austria]] (KPÖ) rise considerably in opinion polls conducted before the legislative election. Previously a non-factor in Austria-wide elections, the party rose to as high as 7 percent after the Salzburg state election in April 2023, in which it received a record 12 percent of the vote, a result out of nowhere, which stunned political observers.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

On 18 October 2023, former chancellor Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) was charged in federal court for allegedly making false statements to a parliamentary investigation committee.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

On 4 November 2023, the KPÖ elected [[Tobias Schweiger]] as its lead candidate for the upcoming election.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

On 11 November 2023, the new SPÖ leader Andreas Babler was confirmed at a party convention in Graz by 89 percent of voting delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orf.at/stories/3339497/|date=11 November 2023|title=SPÖ-Parteitag: 88,76 Prozent für Babler als Parteichef|website=[[ORF (broadcaster)|orf]].at}}</ref>

On 18 January 2024, Dominik Wlazny (alias [[Marco Pogo]]) announced the candidacy of the [[The Beer Party (Austria)|Beer Party]] (BIER).<ref>{{cite web |author=Florian Amelin |date=2024-01-18 |title=ANTRETEN BEI NATIONALRATSWAHL: "Günstige Gemengelage" für Bierpartei |url=https://orf.at/stories/3346049/ |access-date=2024-01-18 |website=news.ORF.at |language=de}}</ref>

===Date===
The election had to be held before the conclusion of the five-year term of the 27th National Council on 23 October 2024 (typically, regularly-scheduled elections are held several weeks earlier than that, to allow for the publication of an official certified election result). Elections are traditionally not held during the school summer holidays, from early July to mid-September.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Due to the government's unpopularity, it was often speculated in the media that early elections would be called for the spring of 2024, but the ÖVP-Green government repeatedly said it wanted to finish its term and that the election would be held in September 2024.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warum Neuwahlen immer unwahrscheinlicher werden|url=https://kurier.at/politik/inland/neuwahlen-unwahrscheinlich-nehammer-kogler-oevp-gruene-fpoe/402650006|publisher=Kurier.at|date=30 October 2023|access-date=11 November 2023}}</ref>

In February 2024, Minister of Agriculture [[Norbert Totschnig]] (ÖVP) mentioned that the election would likely be held on Sunday 29 September 2024, exactly five years after the previous election.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

On 28 June 2024, the federal government formally announced the election date of 29 September 2024.<ref>{{cite web|title=Verordnung der Bundesregierung über die Ausschreibung der Wahl zum Nationalrat, die Festsetzung des Wahltages und des Stichtages (BGBl.

==Electoral system==
[[File:Wien - Parlamentsgebäude.JPG|200px|thumb|Austrian Parliament in Vienna (2023)]]
The 183 members of the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] are elected by [[open list]] [[proportional representation]] at three levels; a single national constituency, nine constituencies based on the [[states of Austria|federal states]], and 39 regional constituencies. Seats are apportioned to the regional constituencies based on the results of the most recent census. For parties to receive any representation in the National Council, they must either win at least one seat in a constituency directly, or clear a 4 percent national [[electoral threshold]].<ref name="system-1">{{cite web|title=Wahlen zum Nationalrat|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/PERK/PARL/DEM/NRWAHL/|publisher=Österreichisches Parlament|date=12 September 2017|access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

Following the elections, seats are allocated to the candidates of successful parties and lists in a three-stage process, starting with the regional constituencies. Seats are distributed according to the [[Hare quota]] in the regional constituencies, and with unallocated seats distributed at the state constituency level.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wahlen|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/412/|publisher=Bundesministerium für Inneres|access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref> Any remaining seats are then allocated using the [[D'Hondt method]] at the federal level, to ensure overall proportionality between a party's national vote share and its share of parliamentary seats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das Verhältniswahlrecht und das Ermittlungsverfahren bei der Nationalratswahl|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/PERK/FAQ/WAHL/ERMNRWAHL/index.shtml|publisher=Österreichisches Parlament|date=21 October 2017|access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

In addition to voting for a political party, voters may cast three preferential votes for specific candidates of that party, but are not required to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/themen/leben_in_oesterreich/wahlen/1/Seite.320260.html|title=Vorzugsstimmenvergabe bei einer Nationalratswahl|website=State of Austria (official website)|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref> These additional votes do not affect the proportional allocation based on the vote for the party or list, but can change the rank order of candidates on a party's lists at the federal, state, and regional level. The threshold to increase the position of a candidate on a federal party list is 7 percent, compared to 10 percent at the state level, and 14 percent at the regional level. The names of candidates on regional party lists are printed on the ballot and can be marked with an "x" to indicate the voter's preference. Preference votes for candidates on party lists at the state and federal level, however, must be written in by the voter, either by writing the name or the rank number of the candidate in a blank spot provided for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vorzugsstimmenvergabe bei einer Nationalratswahl|url=https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/32/Seite.320260.html|publisher=HELP.gv.at|date=1 January 2017|access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

===Voting law reform===
The ÖVP–Green government decided in early 2023 to reform the voting law. Among the reforms were the introduction of an early voting period, beginning three weeks before election day, during which voters can request absentee ballots in every municipality. Voters can either fill out the ballot in the municipality and therefore cast the ballot early, or take the absentee ballot with them and cast it later by mail, or in-person before or on election day. Previously, this was only possible in large cities. Another reform will be the counting of almost all absentee and mail-ballots on election day. Previously, most mail ballots were counted on the Monday and Thursday after election day. The new changes would lead to most votes being counted on election day, while only a much smaller number of late-arriving mail ballots and mail ballots from electoral districts other than the voters' own district will be counted on the Monday after election day. The [[2024 European Parliament election in Austria]] was the first national election in which the new law took effect, and it showed that only about 130,000 absentee ballots had to be counted on the Monday after election day, compared to almost 960,000 on the Monday after the 2019 legislative election. Other reforms include measures to lower the number of invalid or spoilt votes among absentee/mail ballots, by re-designing mail ballot instructions and introduction of "easy language" (or [[plain language]]) on them. High fines and a prison sentence of up to two weeks will be introduced for election commission members who deliberately leak election results of their polling stations to the media or other third parties before poll closing time. The reform of the voting law, which took effect on 1 January 2024, was also supported by the three opposition parties SPÖ, FPÖ and NEOS, after several amendments were made to satisfy these parties too. The reformed election law<ref>{{cite web|title=Wahlrechtsänderungsgesetz 2023 (3002/A)|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/gegenstand/XXVII/A/3002|publisher=Österreichisches Parlament (Austrian Parliament)|date=22 November 2022|access-date=5 November 2023}}</ref> was approved by the Nationalrat (National Council) on 31 January 2023 and by the Bundesrat ([[Federal Council (Austria)|Federal Council]]) on 16 February 2023.<ref>{{cite web|title=PARLAMENTSKORRESPONDENZ NR. 91 VOM 31.01.2023: Nationalrat gibt grünes Licht für Wahlrechtsreform - Gesetzespaket erhielt nach weiterer Adaptierung einhellige Zustimmung|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/aktuelles/pk/jahr_2023/pk0091|publisher=Österreichisches Parlament (Austrian Parliament)|date=31 January 2023|access-date=5 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wahlrecht wird reformiert – was sich alles ändert|url=https://gemeindebund.at/wahlrecht-wird-reformiert-was-sich-alles-aendert/|publisher=Österreichischer Gemeindebund (Austrian Association of Municipalities)|date=21 November 2022|access-date=5 November 2023}}</ref>

==Statistics==
According to final numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, a total of 6,346,059 people were eligible to vote in the election. In the 2019 election, 6,396,812 people were eligible to vote, so the number of eligible voters fell by 50,753 people. This is because the number of Austrian citizens has been falling for years due to a birth deficit and negative migration balance to abroad, which is not compensated for by the number of naturalizations.

Absentee/mail ballots were sent to voters who requested them, starting 2 September 2024. Early voting in every municipality was also possible from that day, by immediately casting absentee ballots there (after requesting them at the municipal election department).{{CN|date=September 2024}}

Electoral authorities all over Austria issued a total of 1,436,240 absentee ballots by 27 September 2024, the last day to request one. This is a new record and much higher than the 1,070,933 issued for the 2019 election. In total, about 23% of all eligible voters requested an absentee ballot, compared to 17% in 2019. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Ministry of the Interior]] projected that every fourth vote cast in this election would be absentee.<ref name=MOIeligible />

==Contesting parties==
Any party that intends to be on the ballot for the election must submit a statement of candidacy, its candidate list, a filing fee of €435 and either the signatures of three members of the Austrian National Council, or sufficient petition signatures of eligible Austrian voters by 1 August 2024 at 17:00 at the federal election commission in the Austrian Interior Ministry. To be on the ballot in all nine states, 2,600 signatures are required, with individual states requiring between 100 and 500 signatures. Parties contesting the election in only some states only need to reach the signature threshold for those states.

==Campaign==
All major parties started their election campaigns in mid-to-late August 2024. First waves of election billboards and campaign posters were placed at heavily frequented places and roads, lead candidates appeared in TV interviews and discussions and ads on social media, radio and TV were launched. Each party can spend a maximum of 8.6 million euros for the election, in accordance with campaign finance laws.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Especially after the [[2024 Vienna terrorism plot]] in early August 2024, in which the [[Islamic State]] unsuccessfully tried to target concerts of the American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], the campaigning shifted heavily towards security and policing issues, how to tackle political and extremist [[Islam in Austria]] and on immigration and the integration of (primarily Muslim) immigrants in Austria.<ref>{{cite web |last=Matzl |first=Christoph |date=2024-08-25 |title=Stricter rules on immigration called for |url=https://www.krone.at/3503571 |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Kronen Zeitung}}</ref> The focus on these topics were reinforced by the [[2024 Solingen stabbing]] in late August 2024 in neighboring Germany, with the FPÖ calling for "zero asylum" in Austria, increased deportations of criminal foreigners to their home countries and a new law to ban [[Islamism|political/extremist Islam]] in Austria, similar to [[Verbotsgesetz 1947|Austria's anti-Nazi law]]<ref>{{cite web |date=2024-08-23 |title=FPÖ vows to curb migration and abolish 'green taxes' |url=https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/08/austrias-fpo-vows-to-curb-migration-abolish-green-taxes-upon-election-win/ |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Brussels Signal |language=en-GB}}</ref> in its campaign program titled "Fortress Austria".<ref name="fortress">{{cite web |date=2024-09-30 |title=Austria's Freedom Party secures first far-right national election win since World War II |url=https://apnews.com/article/austria-national-election-far-right-freedom-party-1a22057b230a2576e0ca0ee69607cf6e |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=Associated Press|language=en-US}}</ref> The FPÖ also called for enshrining legal recognitions of binary genders in the constitution,<ref>{{cite web |date=2024-09-29 |title=Is Austria's far right poised for historic win in Sunday elections? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/28/is-austrias-far-right-poised-for-historic-win-in-sunday-elections |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en-US}}</ref> restoring some political powers from the [[European Union]] to Austria,<ref name="fortress"/> ending [[sanctions against Russia]] and Austria's exit from the [[European Sky Shield Initiative]].

The SPÖ and the ÖVP both attacked Herbert Kickl, with its leaders describing him as "a threat to democracy" and a "security risk". Both parties pledged not to join a government led by the FPÖ, although Karl Nehammer has not ruled out forming a coalition with the FPÖ that would exclude Kickl from the cabinet.<ref>{{cite web |date=2024-09-29 |title=Austrians vote as a far-right party hopes for its first national election win |url=https://apnews.com/article/austria-national-election-far-right-freedom-party-1a22057b230a2576e0ca0ee69607cf6e |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=Associated Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

The FPÖ's use of the term ''Volkskanzler'' (People's Chancellor) to describe Kickl in its campaign material has caused criticism among some Austrians for its usage by [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1930s and as a reminder of the FPÖ's origins as a party founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2024-09-28 |title=Austria's far right eyes unprecedented election win |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4xz013zx7o |access-date=2024-09-28 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |language=en-GB}}</ref>

According to experts from Foresight (ex-SORA), about 90 percent of the 1.436 million requested absentee ballots will be returned for counting. Of those roughly 1.3 million ballots, the vast majority (roughly 1.1 million, or 85%) would be counted on 29 September, while an estimated remaining 15% or 160,000 late-arriving absentee ballots would be counted – by law – on 30 September and an additional 40,000 (from another district than the voters' own) would be counted – by law – on 3 October.<ref>{{cite web |title=17.09.2024 Nationalratswahl |date=17 September 2024 |url=https://www.foresight.at/news/nationalratswahl-2024 |access-date=29 September 2024}}</ref> Reports of polling stations throughout election day suggested that overall turnout was "very high" and could reach "80 percent or more".<ref>{{cite news |title=Erste Hochrechnung: FPÖ Wahlsieger mit 29,1 Prozent + ÖVP 26,2 Prozent + SPÖ 20,4 Prozent |url=https://www.kleinezeitung.at/politik/wahl/18907056/nationalratswahl-2024-liveticker-oesterreich-waehlt |access-date=29 September 2024 |language=de}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Celebrations broke out among FPÖ supporters after initial projections showed them winning a plurality of votes. FPÖ general secretary [[Michael Schnedlitz]] said "the men and women of Austria have made history today", while [[Herbert Kickl]] called on other parties to reconsider forming a coalition with his party. In response, Karl Nehammer reiterated that the ÖVP would not enter into a coalition with the FPÖ unless Kickl was excluded from a ministerial position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Far right in Austria set for election victory - projections |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rdygy5888o |publisher=BBC News |access-date=29 September 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Austria's far-right Freedom Party projected to win election |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/29/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-projected-to-win-election |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=29 September 2024}}</ref> Nehammer also said he was "bitter" over the ÖVP failing to win but acknowledged his role in improving the party's showing following low opinion ratings.<ref name="fortress"/>

A plurality of voters preferred a coalition by FPÖ-ÖVP (29%), followed by ÖVP-SPÖ-NEOS (23%), ÖVP-SPÖ-Greens (12%), ÖVP-SPÖ (9%), FPÖ-SPÖ (9%), other coalitions (3%), and 15% undecided.<ref>{{cite web |title=Umfrage: Bei Neuwahl könnt FPÖ 30-%-Marke knacken |url=https://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/politik/nationalratswahl/umfrage-bei-neuwahl-koennt-fpoe-30-marke-knacken/608263286 |work=oe24.at |access-date=4 October 2024}}</ref> Another new poll after the election by Unique Research for Heute found that 58% of Austrians want the Austrian president to officially task the FPÖ with forming the next government, while 36% were opposed. Among FPÖ voters, 98% were in favour, among ÖVP voters the support was at 54%, and 44% were opposed. Among all other party voters, opposition outweighed support.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wahl-Knaller: Mehrheit will, dass Kickl Regierung sucht |url=https://www.heute.at/s/wahl-knaller-mehrheit-will-dass-kickl-regierung-sucht-120064986 |work=heute.at |access-date=4 October 2024}}</ref>

===Government formation===

President [[Alexander Van der Bellen]] pledged to ensure the formation of a government that respects the "foundations of our [[liberal democracy]]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Austria far-right supporters toast historic victory |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240930-austria-far-right-supporters-toast-historic-victory |work=France 24 |date=30 September 2024 |access-date=30 September 2024}}</ref> Although it is a [[Convention (political norm)|convention]] that the president first asks the leader of the largest party to try to form a government, the [[Constitution of Austria|constitution]] does not require them to do so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Francois |title=Austria's president takes charge as far right isolated after election victory |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrias-president-takes-charge-far-right-isolated-after-election-victory-2024-09-30/ |work=Reuters |date=30 September 2024}}</ref> Van der Bellen previously stated that he might not give FPÖ this mandate in the event of their victory.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gespräche bei Van der Bellen: Kickl macht den Anfang |url=https://orf.at/stories/3371816/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=3 October 2024 |language=de}}</ref> On 2 October, the outgoing ÖVP-Green government tendered its resignation, although it was asked to stay on in a caretaker role by Van der Bellen. The president then started official talks with all party leaders on 4 October, with FPÖ leader Kickl being the first to talk with the president. Van der Bellen and Kickl made no statements after their meeting but Kickl said he would do so on 5 October.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regierung mit Fortführung betraut |url=https://orf.at/stories/3371674/ |work=ORF.at |access-date=2 October 2024}}</ref> Nehammer and other ÖVP governors expressed support for the FPÖ receiving the first mandate to form a government, citing a wish to preserve the convention.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Francois |title=Austria's conservatives want far right to be asked to form coalition |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrias-conservatives-want-far-right-be-tasked-with-forming-coalition-2024-10-01/ |work=Reuters |date=1 October 2024}}</ref>

The president spoke on 7 October with Nehammer (ÖVP) and Babler (SPÖ)—who also met with each other the next day—and on 8 October with Meinl-Reisinger (NEOS) and Kogler (Greens).<ref>{{cite news |title=Medien: ÖVP und SPÖ reden miteinander am Dienstag |url=https://orf.at/stories/3371943/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=5 October 2024 |language=de}}</ref> Babler had previously ruled out a coalition government with ÖVP,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Oltermann |first=Philip |date=2023-06-05 |title=Austrian Social Democrats announce wrong leader after ‘technical error’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/austrian-social-democrats-announce-wrong-leader-after-technical-error |access-date=2025-04-16 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |quote=Unlike Doskozil, Babler has ruled out forming a “grand coalition” with Austria’s conservatives.}}</ref> but backtracked .<ref>{{Cite web |title=Andreas Babler Has Disappointed the Austrian Left |url=https://jacobin.com/2024/12/austria-babler-spo-left-right |access-date=2025-04-16 |website=jacobin.com |language=en-US}}</ref>After these initial talks with each party leader, Van der Bellen said he asked the party leaders to "sort things out on their own" until 18 October rather than tasking the FPÖ with the mandate to form the next government. Van der Bellen said that the situation is unique in the sense that no other party wants to cooperate with the FPÖ and that it would be ludicrous to order the FPÖ to form a government in this situation. Instead, Van der Bellen ordered the parties to keep talking with each other until a credible path to a government appears, after which he would task the leading party of this constellation to form the next government. Meanwhile, the FPÖ rose to a new high of 33% in [[Next Austrian legislative election#Opinion polls|a new Market-Lazarsfeld poll for Ö24]], with the ÖVP holding at 26% and the SPÖ falling slightly to 19% (below 20% for the first time); the minor parties held fairly steady: NEOS at 10%, the Green Party at 7%, KPÖ at 2%, and others at 3%.<ref>{{cite news |title=NACH DER WAHL: Regierungsbildung als Präzedenzfall |url=https://orf.at/stories/3372386/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=10 October 2024 |language=de}}</ref>

After the FPÖ–ÖVP–SPÖ talks concluded on 16 October, Nehammer reiterated his opposition to a government with Kickl, who insisted to lead the next government himself as Chancellor. Nehammer said "Kickl is unable to govern," adding that he was a "security threat for the country" and that "Nehammer and the ÖVP are not willing to be the stirrup holders of Kickl and the FPÖ." On the other hand, Kickl called Nehammer "an offended and aggrieved sore loser, whose main goal is to continue clinging to power, but without the interests of the country and voters in mind."<ref>{{cite news |title=KICKL: Nehammer "beleidigter Wahlverlierer" |url=https://orf.at/stories/3372962/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=16 October 2024 |language=de}}</ref>

On 22 October, Van der Bellen officially asked Nehammer to form the next government and negotiate with the SPÖ.<ref>{{cite news |title=Austria's chancellor asked to form new government after parties refuse to work with far-right leader |url=https://apnews.com/article/austria-president-nehammer-chancellor-government-far-right-b7c91e9030d266d92f348f52acd9e5a8 |work=Associated Press |date=22 October 2024}}</ref> Van der Bellen said that it was clear that Kickl "would not be able to find a coalition partner who would make him Chancellor," while Kickl criticised Van der Bellen for breaking with the "tried and tested normal processes" of asking the leading party in the election to form a government and pledged, "Today is not the end of the story."<ref>{{cite news |title=Austria far right shunned for coalition despite winning election |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx252kedeppo |publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 2024}}</ref> Nehammer said that he would need to find a third coalition partner to ensure a stable parliamentary majority. An ÖVP–SPÖ coalition would only have a majority of one seat in the National Council, which would be impractical for daily government work, as any member would have the power to block proceedings.

On 25 October, Nehammer and the ÖVP officially launched first exploration talks with Babler and the SPÖ. Nehammer also talked with NEOS and Green delegations to try to find a third coalition partner. After the talks, Nehammer said that the "road to a new government will be long and stony" because of the "massive policy differences between the parties involved."<ref>{{cite news |title=DREIERKOALITION: NEOS mit besseren Chancen als Grüne |url=https://orf.at/stories/3373886/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=25 October 2024 |language=de}}</ref>

==== Failed ÖVP-SPÖ-NEOS coalition negotiations ====
On 12 November, the centre-right [[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]] and the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]] announced they would start coalition talks with the liberal [[NEOS (Austria)|NEOS]].<ref>{{cite news |title=SONDIERUNGEN: ÖVP und SPÖ laden NEOS ein |url=https://orf.at/stories/3375755/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=12 November 2024 |language=de}}</ref> The talks started on 18 November.<ref>{{cite web |date=2024-11-18 |title=Startschuss für Verhandlungen über eine Koalition ÖVP – SPÖ – NEOS |url=https://www.trend.at/politik/startschuss-fuer-koalitionsverhandlungen-zwischen-oevp-spoe-und-neos |access-date=2024-11-18 |website=trend.at |language=de}}</ref>

On 3 January 2025, various Austrian media outlets reported that NEOS had withdrawn from coalition talks, leaving it unclear how government negotiations would move forward. It was reported that the [[The Greens (Austria)|Green Party]] could be asked to join negotiations or that negotiations between only the FPÖ and ÖVP or FPÖ and SPÖ could start instead. Alternatively, new elections could be called.<ref>{{cite news |title=NEOS dürfte aus Koalitionsverhandlungen austreten |url=https://orf.at/stories/3380629/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=3 January 2025 |language=de}}</ref>

On 4 January, after consultations with President Van der Bellen, ÖVP and SPÖ continued coalition talks without any other party.<ref>{{cite news |title=ÖVP und SPÖ verhandeln wieder |url=https://orf.at/stories/3380737/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=4 January 2025 |language=de}}</ref> However, Nehammer resigned as chancellor and ÖVP leader later that same day after concluding that no agreement was possible.<ref name="resigned">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-04/austrian-chancellor-nehammer-steps-down-as-coalition-talks-fail|title=Austrian Chancellor Nehammer Steps Down as Coalition Talks Fail |accessdate=4 January 2025|website=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref> 

Nehammer was replaced by [[Christian Stocker]] as interim ÖVP leader the same day, and his resignation as chancellor took effect on 10 January. When asked why he was resigning before then, he said only it was a step he did not want to take. In a statement, Nehammer said his ultimate goal was to keep Kickl out of the chancellor's office "because I have always been of the opinion that his understanding of the office [and] the way he lives politics is not good for our country", though there were "many reasons" why he failed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nehammer wird am Freitag als Kanzler zurücktreten |url=https://orf.at/stories/3381038/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=6 January 2025 |language=de}}</ref>

==== Failed FPÖ-ÖVP coalition negotiations ====
On 6 January, President Van der Bellen formally tasked [[Freedom Party of Austria|FPÖ]] leader [[Herbert Kickl]] to form a government.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/6/austrian-president-tasks-far-right-leader-with-forming-government | title=Austrian president tasks far-right leader with forming government }}</ref> The coalition talks continued through February, with no reported breakthrough.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-31 |title=Koalitionsverhandlungen laufen weiter |url=https://www.vienna.at/koalitionsverhandlungen-auch-am-wochenende/9191671 |access-date=2025-02-01 |website=vienna.at}}</ref> The FPÖ and ÖVP negotiated for over a month about forming a new government. 

The FPÖ advocated for substantial tax cuts, increased public borrowing and reduced contributions to EU-wide financial mechanisms. These policies clashed with the ÖVP, which remained committed to fiscal discipline and adherence to [[European Union|EU]] economic frameworks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-27 |title=Far right gets shut out as Austrian government forms |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-coalition-forms-prevents-far-right-power/ |access-date=2025-03-04 |website=POLITICO |language=en-GB}}</ref> Additionally, the FPÖ's Russia-friendly stance and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] views clashed with the ÖVP's pro-European and pro-NATO alignment.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Henley |first=Jon |last2=Henley |first2=Jon |date=2025-02-27 |title=Austrian centrist parties reach deal to form government without far right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/27/austria-centrist-parties-deal-form-government-without-far-right |access-date=2025-03-04 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> 

On 12 February, Kickl announced after a meeting with President Alexander Van der Bellen in Vienna that the negotiations had failed. The parties had argued primarily about the distribution of ministries, because both sides wanted to take over the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Ministry of the Interior]] and the [[Ministry of Finance (Austria)|Ministry of Finance]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Koalitionsgespräche von FPÖ und ÖVP in Österreich gescheitert |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/oesterreich-koalitionsverhandlungen-gescheitert-102.html |access-date=2025-02-12 |website=Tagesschau |language=de}}</ref> According to [[Christian Stocker]], the ÖVP wanted to retain control over the finance and interior ministries to secure a “defensible constitutional state” and ensure cooperation with international intelligence services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-12 |title=Austria’s political crisis deepens as far right pulls plug on coalition talks |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-coalition-talks-collapse-far-right-herbert-kickl-freedom-party-fpo-peoples-party-ovp/ |access-date=2025-03-04 |website=POLITICO |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sattler |first=Armin |last2=Bauer |first2=Patrick |last3=Lenzer |first3=Florian Zischkaund Harald |last4=ORF.at |first4=alle |date=2025-02-10 |title=Kickl für „rasche Neuwahlen“ |url=https://orf.at/live/5463-Kickl-fuer-rasche-Neuwahlen-/#e40317 |access-date=2025-03-04 |website=news.ORF.at |language=de}}</ref>

==== Successful ÖVP-SPÖ-NEOS coalition negotiations ====

On 22 February, after a week of exploration talks, the three parties informed President Van der Bellen that they will try to create a joint government again. The negotiations were already in its final stages, because most topics have already been agreed on during their previous failed negotiations and even some measures from the FPÖ-ÖVP negotiations, such as the planned budget consolidation for 2025, were likely to be adopted.<ref>{{cite news |title=ÖVP, SPÖ, NEOS: Verhandlungen „auf der Zielgeraden“ |url=https://orf.at/stories/3385594/ |work=news.ORF.at |date=22 February 2025 |language=de}}</ref>

On 27 February, the leaders of the three parties announced that they had come to a coalition agreement. The agreement was subjected to a vote of NEOS party members on 2 March, passing with 94% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Austria: Centrist parties form coalition without far-right |url=https://www.dw.com/en/austria-centrist-parties-form-coalition-without-far-right/a-71765298 |work=dw.com/en |date=2 March 2025 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2 March 2025 |title=Austrian liberals' vote removes last obstacle to coalition government|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-liberals-hold-party-vote-crucial-future-coalition-government-2025-03-02/|access-date=2 March 2025 |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> The coalition will have 110 deputies, greater than the 92 needed for a majority.

On 3 March, President [[Alexander Van der Bellen|Van der Bellen]] officially swore in the new [[Stocker government|three-party coalition government]]. [[Christian Stocker]] of the ÖVP took office as Chancellor, while [[Andreas Babler]] of the SPÖ was appointed Vice Chancellor, and [[Beate Meinl-Reisinger]] of NEOS assumed the role of Foreign Minister.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liveticker-Nachlese: Österreich hat eine neue Bundesregierung |url=https://www.derstandard.at/consent/tcf/jetzt/livebericht/3000000259591/angelobung-live-neue-regierung-abbei-van-der-bellen?ref=live_red_content&responsive=false |access-date=2025-03-04 |website=DER STANDARD |language=de-AT}}</ref> In his remarks, Van der Bellen praised the coalition for putting the national interest above party divisions, stating, "Good things come to those who wait."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-03-03 |title=Austria swears in new government, ending five-month political crisis |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-swears-new-government-ending-five-month-political-crisis-christian-stocker-alexander-van-der-bellen/ |access-date=2025-03-04 |website=POLITICO |language=en-GB}}</ref>
