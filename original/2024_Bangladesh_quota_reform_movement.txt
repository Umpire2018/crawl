The protest began in June 2024, in response to the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] [[Ohidul Islam and others v. The Government of Bangladesh and others|reinstating]] a 30% quota for descendants of [[Mukti Bahini|freedom fighters]], reversing the government decision made in response to the [[2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement]]. Students began to feel like they have a limited opportunity based on merit. The protest quickly spread throughout the entire country because of the government's violent response, as well as growing public dissatisfaction against an oppressive government. The situation was further complicated by many other ongoing issues, like the government's inability to manage a prolonged [[Recession|economic downturn]], reports of rampant corruption and human rights violations, and the absence of [[Democracy|democratic]] channels for initiating changes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lu |first=Christina |date=2024-08-07 |title=What's Behind Bangladesh's Student Protests? |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/18/bangladesh-student-protests-quota-system/ |access-date=2024-08-03 |website=Foreign Policy |language=en-US |archive-date=4 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240804023456/https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/18/bangladesh-student-protests-quota-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-10 |title=Is the system rigged against meritocracy? |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/the-system-rigged-against-meritocracy-3653471 |access-date=2024-08-03 |website=The Daily Star |language=en |archive-date=16 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240716063251/https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/the-system-rigged-against-meritocracy-3653471 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Ahmed |first1=Redwan |last2=Ellis-Petersen |first2=Hannah |date=2024-07-26 |title=Bangladesh student protests turn into 'mass movement against a dictator' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator |access-date=2024-08-03 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=4 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240804023457/https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |author=Charlie Campbell |date=2023-11-02 |title=Sheikh Hasina and the Future of Democracy in Bangladesh |url=https://time.com/6330463/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-wazed-profile/ |access-date=2024-08-03 |magazine=TIME |language=en |archive-date=4 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240104145458/https://time.com/6330463/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-wazed-profile/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Background ==
{{Further|Quota system of Bangladesh Civil Service}}
After the High Court ruled in favor of quotas on 5 June 2024, the students of various universities in Dhaka united to demand quota reform. After the movement was initially started, it was postponed due to [[Eid al-Adha]] and the summer holidays. After the holidays, the agitation started again peacefully but gradually became widespread. Initially, the students and teachers of many public universities and other educational institutions joined the movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daily-sun.com/post/757945|title=Universities outside Dhaka also heat up with quota movement|website=[[Daily Sun (Bangladesh)|Daily Sun]]|date=15 July 2024|access-date=1 August 2024|archive-date=18 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240718080738/https://www.daily-sun.com/post/757945|url-status=live}}</ref> Later, the students of private universities also followed suit by joining the public demonstration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/private-university-students-join-quota-reform-movement-protests-3657691|title=Private university students join Quota Reform Movement protests|website=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=15 July 2024|access-date=1 August 2024|archive-date=1 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240801015824/https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/private-university-students-join-quota-reform-movement-protests-3657691|url-status=live}}</ref> Under the banner of [[Anti-discrimination Students Movement]] ({{langx|bn|বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলন}}), students started the '''Bangla Blockade'''. During the movement, the Appellate Division issued a status quo for four weeks on 10 July, canceling the freedom fighters' quota. Reacting to the court verdict, the students said they are seeking a final solution to the quota issue from the government, claiming the movement has nothing to do with the court. The protest also affected the domestic train and road transportation networks across Bangladesh.<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 July 2024 |script-title=bn:কোটা আন্দোলন: মুক্তিযোদ্ধা কোটা বহাল করে হাইকোর্টের রায়ে স্থিতাবস্থা আপিল বিভাগের |title=Kōṭā āndōlana: Muktiyōd'dhā kōṭā bahāla karē hā'ikōrṭēra rāẏē sthitābasthā āpila bibhāgēra |trans-title=Quota Movement: Muktijoddha upheld the status quo Appellate Division in the judgment of the High Court |url=https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/c134k1k56e0o |access-date=14 July 2024 |work=[[BBC News]] বাংলা |language=bn |archive-date=11 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711012009/https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/c134k1k56e0o |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Julhas |last=Alam |url=https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-quota-violence-hasina-student-protests-c3982590332a1639c88a22257e20f7d2 |title=Violent clashes over government jobs quota system leave scores injured in Bangladesh |date=16 July 2024 |work=[[AP News]] |access-date=16 July 2024 |archive-date=16 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240716094043/https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-quota-violence-hasina-student-protests-c3982590332a1639c88a22257e20f7d2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The mass killings carried out by the law enforcement agencies were described as "[[July massacre]]" in various sources. A preliminary report by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] published on 16 August 2024 stated that more than 400 fatalities were reported nationwide between 16 July and 4 August, mainly due to violence carried out by state forces such as the [[Bangladesh Police]], [[Rapid Action Battalion|RAB]], [[Border Guard Bangladesh|BGB]] and [[Bangladesh Army|Army]], as well as the [[Bangladesh Chhatra League|Chhatra League]]. The report stated that restrictions on communication and state interference in hospitals make this figure an undercount.<ref name="OHCHR">{{Cite report |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/preliminary-analysis-recent-protests-and-unrest-bangladesh |title=Preliminary Analysis of Recent Protests and Unrest in Bangladesh |pages=6–7 |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |publication-date=2024-08-16 |quote=According to available public reports by media and the protest movement itself, between 16 July and 11 August, more than 600 people were killed. Of these, nearly 400 deaths were reported from 16 July to 4 August, while around 250 people were reportedly killed following the new wave of protests between 5 and 6 August. [...] The reported death toll is likely an underestimate, as information collection has been hindered by restrictions on movement due to the curfew and the internet shutdown.
