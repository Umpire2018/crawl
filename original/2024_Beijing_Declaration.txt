==Background==
Following the outbreak of the [[Israel–Hamas war]] in October 2023, the Israeli military advanced into the [[Gaza Strip]]. Over the course of the war, a [[United Nations]] agency and international organisations including [[Amnesty International]] have found that Israel [[Gaza Genocide|is committing genocide]] in Gaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=16 November 2023 |title=Gaza: UN experts call on international community to prevent genocide against the Palestinian people |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/11/gaza-un-experts-call-international-community-prevent-genocide-against |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224050530/https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/11/gaza-un-experts-call-international-community-prevent-genocide-against |archive-date=24 December 2023 |access-date=22 December 2023 |website=[[OHCHR]] |quote=Grave violations committed by Israel against Palestinians in the aftermath of 7 October, particularly in Gaza, point to a genocide in the making, UN experts said today. They illustrated evidence of increasing genocidal incitement, overt intent to "destroy the Palestinian people under occupation", loud calls for a 'second Nakba' in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, and the use of powerful weaponry with inherently indiscriminate impacts, resulting in a colossal death toll and destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure.}}</ref><ref>{{cite report |author=Amnesty International |author-link=Amnesty International |year=2024 |title='You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel's Genocide Against Palestinians In Gaza |url=https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Amnesty-International-Gaza-Genocide-Report-December-4-2024.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241205121850/https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Amnesty-International-Gaza-Genocide-Report-December-4-2024.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref> This crisis prompted the [[Palestinian Authority]] in [[Ramallah]] and the Hamas leadership to try to reach a new agreement on a unity government with the goal of reaching a common plan of action for the eventual reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Previous such agreements have never been fully implemented.

[[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] are currently the two largest of the Palestinian factions. Founded in 1959, Fatah is the leading member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), which is an umbrella organization consisting of several movements. It takes a moderate stance on the conflict with Israel, favoring a [[two-state solution]] where the Palestinian state would be built on the [[West Bank]] and Gaza Strip, with [[East Jerusalem]] as its capital.

Hamas, on the other hand, is a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement founded in 1987, that advocates for [[One-state solution|one Palestinian state]] in the entire territory. However, in recent years Hamas has accepted a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza as a temporary solution to the conflict, supporting the [[Green Line (Israel)|pre-1967 borders]] in its [[2017 Hamas charter|2017 charter]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Diaspora Entrepreneurs and Contested States|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Maria Koinova|page=150}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Zartman |first=Jonathan |date=2021 |title=Conflict in the Modern Middle East: An Encyclopedia of Civil War, Revolutions, and Regime Change |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9798400630415 |page=230}}</ref>

==Negotiations==
The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] offered the Palestinian factions its good offices to try to reach an agreement, and in July 2024, representatives of 14 Palestinian organizations met in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. On July 23, they concluded a new agreement on unity government.<ref name=washpost>{{Cite news |last1=Shepherd |first1=Christian |last2=Hendrix |first2=Steve |last3=Masih |first3=Niha |last4=Dadouch |first4=Sarah |date=2024-07-23 |title=China brokers Palestinian unity declaration in bid to be global mediator |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/23/china-hamas-fatah-palestine-beijing-declaration/ |access-date=5 January 2025 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |archive-date=24 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240724020930/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/23/china-hamas-fatah-palestine-beijing-declaration/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The most prominent highlight in the deal is a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of Gaza after the war with Israel, as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] said.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/world/hamas-fatah-meet-with-media-china-after-reconciliation-talks-2024-07-23/ Palestinian factions agree to form unity government], Reuters.</ref> Wang further described the meeting as a "historic moment for the cause of Palestine’s liberation".<ref name=washpost/>

The negotiations were witnessed by envoys from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Palestinian Factions Sign Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity |url=https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202407/t20240723_11458788.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240727145851/https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjdt_665385/wshd_665389/202407/t20240723_11458788.html |archive-date=27 July 2024 |access-date=27 July 2024 |work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Republic of China}}</ref>

==Agreement==
According to the declaration, the factions agreed to achieve "a comprehensive Palestinian national unity that includes all Palestinian factions under the [[PLO]] framework, and to commit to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital […] with the help of Egypt, Algeria, China and Russia". They stated that this would take the form of a temporary national unity government. They further "agreed to deploy all efforts to lift the Israeli blockade on Gaza and ensure the unimpeded delivery of [[humanitarian aid]] into the enclave".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/beijing-declaration-china-brokers-hamas-fatah-unity-deal-what-we-know|title='The Beijing Declaration,' China brokers Hamas-Fatah unity deal: What we know|date=July 23, 2024|first=Beatrice|last=Farhat|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|access-date=24 July 2024|archive-date=24 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240724195409/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/beijing-declaration-china-brokers-hamas-fatah-unity-deal-what-we-know|url-status=live}}</ref>

The declaration also stressed the Palestinian people's [[Palestinian right to resist|right to resist]] the Israeli occupation in accordance with [[international law]] and the [[Charter of the United Nations|United Nations charter]] and to thwart any attempts to displace Palestinians from their land.

== Analysis ==
=== Role of China ===
In hosting the conference, analysts including [[Foreign Policy]] reporter Amy Mackinnon saw China as seeking to position itself as a rival mediator to the United States in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mackinnon |first=Amy |date=2024-09-10 |title=China Tries to Play Power Broker Among Palestinians |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/23/china-hamas-fatah-unity-agreement-palestine/ |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Foreign Policy |language=en-US}}</ref> Similarly, Palestinian China expert Razan Shawamreh said China aimed "to gain consent and acknowledgment among regional countries regarding its rising status as a responsible country with a superior moral role compared to the US".<ref name=mee/> [[Royal United Services Institute|RUSI]] associate fellow Sari Arho Havrén stated China "positioned itself as a peacemaker and a viable alternative to the US".<ref name=mee>{{cite web |last1=Uddin |first1=Rayhan |last2=Masarwa |first2=Lubna |date=23 July 2024 |title=China challenges West on Gaza by offering Palestinians a new platform |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/china-challenges-west-gaza-offering-palestinians-platform |website=[[Middle East Eye]] |access-date=5 January 2025}}</ref>

Analyst Dominika Urhová described the Beijing Declaration as a continuation of earlier Chinese attempts to play a prominent diplomatic role in the area, citing the five-point peace plan which China proposed at the [[United Nations Security Council]] in November 2023. However, she also observed that China is engaging more directly with the Palestinian groups than before, instead of remaining "careful not to alienate Israel".<ref>{{cite web |last=Urhová |first=Dominika |date=20 August 2024 |title=Beijing Declaration: China’s role in post-war Middle East |url=https://ceias.eu/beijing-declaration-chinas-role-in-post-war-middle-east |website=Central European Institute of Asian Studies |access-date=5 January 2025}}</ref>

Hani al-Masri, director of the Palestinian Centre for Policy Research and Strategic Studies (Masarat), suggested that [[Mahmoud Abbas]] - by engaging in a China-led agreement - "wants to show the Americans and also the Arabs that ‘I have other choices’". Masri linked this to the looming prospect of [[Donald Trump]]'s reelection as well as a recent Israeli bill that rejected Palestinian statehood.<ref name=mee/> According to him, Fatah hopes to use the agreement as leverage "in case it is denied leadership of post-war Gaza". Masri was also more sceptical about the perceived shift in Chinese policy towards a more pro-Palestinian stance, stating that China has not made any steps to "punish Israel, with whom it has special relations" within the UN or other international organisations.<ref name=angieri/>

=== Significance of the agreement ===
A number of Palestinian observers, including [[Palestinian National Council|PNC]] member Hamadeh Faraneh and national affairs advisor for the Palestinian Authority Omar Al-Ghoul, acknowledged both the positives and the ambiguities of the agreement. Faraneh was especially critical about the prospect of unity as "Fatah monopolizes both the authority in [[Ramallah]] and the leadership of the PLO, and Hamas monopolizes Gaza".<ref name=angieri/> However, researcher Jehad Harb argued that the most surprising aspect of the declaration was the shift in Hamas's political thought, as it committed for the first time in an unambiguous way "to the establishment of a Palestinian state according to UN resolutions".<ref name=angieri/>

Some Western and international analysts of Palestinian politics dismissed the agreement as the latest in a series of symbolic documents, with no timetable of practical steps to be implemented so long as Hamas refused to dismantle its separate [[Al-Qassam Brigades|armed wing]] outside of official Palestinian control.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Chen |first1=Laurie |last2=Al-Mughrabi |first2=Nidal |date=23 July 2024 |title=China brokers Palestinian unity deal, but doubts persist |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/hamas-fatah-meet-with-media-china-after-reconciliation-talks-2024-07-23 |work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Rasgon |first1=Adam |last2=Stevenson |first2=Alexandra |date=2024-07-23 |title=Multiple past attempts to broker unity have failed. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/world/middleeast/fatah-hamas-china-statement.html |access-date=2024-07-31 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Jack Khoury of [[Haaretz]] cited a senior Fatah official as saying "the joint statement was mainly intended to show respect to the Chinese hosts, as in similar past conventions in Moscow and Algeria, and therefore it does not have much practical significance."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Khoury |first=Jack |date=23 July 2024 |title=Hamas, Fatah Sign Palestinian 'Unity' Agreement in China, With No Practical Significance |url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-07-23/ty-article/.premium/hamas-fatah-sign-palestinian-unity-agreement-in-china-with-no-practical-significance/00000190-df7d-d851-afbe-df7d78fa0000 |work=Haaretz}}</ref>

This scepticism was shared by Omar Karmi of [[The Electronic Intifada]]. Karmi criticized the declaration's "vagueness", its focus on a "[[Technocracy|technocratic]]" unity government, and the lack of a timeline for implementation. On the other hand, he also saw a limited potential for progress in the growing Chinese role as it could "offset Washington’s outsized influence over diplomacy on Palestine".<ref>{{cite web |last=Karmi |first=Omar |date=24 July 2024 |title=Palestinian factions sign Beijing agreement but deep obstacles remain |url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/omar-karmi/palestinian-factions-sign-beijing-agreement-deep-obstacles-remain |website=[[The Electronic Intifada]] |access-date=5 January 2025}}</ref>

Palestinian journalist and author [[Ramzy Baroud]] reacted more positively to the declaration. In 2023, after an earlier visit by Abbas to Beijing, Baroud had been sceptical: "Palestinians need China, as they need other powerful players in the Global South, but it is not mediation that they desperately require. Mediations do not end military occupations or dismantle apartheid regimes."<ref>{{cite web |last=Baroud |first=Ramzy |date=15 August 2023 |title=Palestinians welcome China’s new Middle East role, but it is not mediation they need |url=https://jordantimes.com/opinion/ramzy-baroud/palestinians-welcome-chinas-new-middle-east-role-it-not-mediation-they-need |website=[[The Jordan Times]] |access-date=5 January 2025}}</ref> By contrast, he claimed that the 2024 Beijing Declaration "has allowed China to engage with all groups on an equal footing, without appearing to side with one group against the other". Baroud also stated that China was gradually ending its earlier "balancing act" between its diplomatic leading role and its economic interests (including those in Israel). According to him, since the war in Gaza started, the Chinese discourse had become "mostly committed to the rights of the Palestinian people".<ref>{{cite web |last=Baroud |first=Ramzy |date=2024 |title=China Tests the Water in Palestinian Diplomacy |url=https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/china-tests-the-water-in-palestinian-diplomacy |website=The Cairo Review of Global Affairs |publisher=[[American University in Cairo]] |access-date=5 January 2025}}</ref>

Menachem Klein, professor of political science at [[Bar-Ilan University]] in Israel, said that the Beijing agreement is based on the [[2012 Fatah–Hamas Cairo Agreement|2012 Cairo agreement]] and the [[2022 Palestinian reconciliation agreement|2022 Algerian agreement]] but, "unlike its predecessors, contains political principles". Klein also stressed that the Chinese agreement, however, shows that "it is impossible to separate Hamas from the PA in Ramallah, and that key figures in Hamas are eventually embarking on the political path championed by Fatah and the PLO", explaining that "this is an opportunity to change the current miserable situation that must not be missed".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Menachem |first=Klein |date=2024-07-31 |title=The Beijing Palestinian Reconciliation Agreement: An Opportunity not to Be Missed |url=https://www.iai.it/sites/default/files/iaicom2448.pdf |work=IAI}}</ref>
