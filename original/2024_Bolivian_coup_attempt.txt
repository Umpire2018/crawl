On 26 June 2024, an attempted [[Coup d'état|military coup]] occurred in [[Bolivia]], orchestrated by dissident officers of the [[Armed Forces of Bolivia|Armed Forces]] led by General [[Juan José Zúñiga]]. Armed troops occupied the [[Plaza Murillo]] in [[La Paz]], the political heart of the country, but withdrew amid domestic and international pressure and after the appointment of a new military high command.

The coup followed weeks of political and economic unease, as a split in [[Movement for Socialism|the ruling party]] between former president [[Evo Morales]] and incumbent [[Luis Arce]] hampered the government's ability to address a looming [[financial crisis]]. Days before the coup, General Juan José Zúñiga declared that the military would arrest Morales if he ran in the [[2025 Bolivian general election|2025 presidential election]]. The resulting scandal ended in Zúñiga's dismissal.

Early on 26 June, [[Bolivian Army]] units began irregular mobilizations, culminating by mid-afternoon in the complete occupation of Plaza Murillo. A tense standoff between soldiers and police joined by protesters lasted for three hours. The day's events included an assault on the historical [[Palacio Quemado]] and a face-to-face altercation between Arce and Zúñiga. The coup plotters lacked meaningful military or political support and were met with bipartisan domestic and international condemnation. [[Law enforcement in Bolivia|Police forces]] opposed the putsch, and the commander of the [[Bolivian Air Force|Air Force]] backed out before a new Army commander appointed by Arce ordered all soldiers to return to their regular posts.

Following his arrest, Zúñiga asserted that the coup attempt had been a ruse masterminded by Arce to drum up popular support. Opponents of the government seized on the accusation, with supporters of Morales, and the [[Opposition (politics)|traditional opposition]], questioning the administration's role in the military uprising. Arce has categorically denied all accusations of a [[self-coup]].{{sfn|PBS News 28 June 2024}}

== Background ==
Bolivia marked its [[transition to democracy]] in 1982 when the [[Armed Forces of Bolivia|Armed Forces]] ceded power to a civilian-led government [[1980 Bolivian general election|elected two years prior]].{{sfn|EFE 9 October 2022}} Despite continued [[Economic stability|economic turmoil]] and [[Political stability|political instability]], the return to civilian rule mostly closed the cycle of volatility that caused the country to experience a multitude of attempted and successful [[Coups d'état in Bolivia|revolutions and coups d'état]] in the two centuries since [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|independence]].{{sfn|Reuters 6 December 2009}}{{sfn|''20 minutos'' 27 June 2024}} By 2024, Bolivia had not faced a coordinated military attempt to seize power in forty-odd years;{{sfn|BBC News 27 June 2024}} the last such venture [[1984 Bolivian coup attempt|occurred in 1984]] but was unsuccessful.{{sfn|''The Hill'' 26 June 2024}}

Antecedents to the most recent crisis stem back to 2019, when the then-[[President of Bolivia|president]], leftist leader [[Evo Morales]], sought reelection to a controversial fourth term in office. Morales's narrow victory in [[2019 Bolivian general election|that year's general election]] was beset by allegations of [[Electoral fraud|fraud]], sparking [[2019 Bolivian protests|mass protests]] that prompted [[2019 Bolivian political crisis|his resignation and the installation of an interim government]]{{snd}}an event Morales's party, the [[Movement for Socialism]] (MAS), deemed a [[coup d'état]]. A [[2020 Bolivian general election|re-run of the election in 2020]] saw [[Luis Arce]], Morales's chosen successor and former finance minister, win the presidency, returning the MAS to power.{{sfn|Associated Press 22 June 2024}}

In the years after assuming office, a widening rift emerged between Arce and Morales over dueling presidential ambitions.{{sfn|''Foreign Policy'' 13 February 2023}} The growing schism culminated in 2023, with Arce's expulsion from the MAS party and Morales's announcement of his candidacy in the [[2025 Bolivian general election|2025 presidential election]]{{sfn|''The Guardian'' 4 October 2023}}{{snd}}even as the [[Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal|Constitutional Tribunal]] revoked a previous ruling enabling him to run indefinitely.{{sfn|''Los Angeles Times'' 30 December 2023}} By the start of 2024, the MAS had splintered into opposing factions loyal to either Arce or Morales. The charged political atmosphere was compounded by a growing [[economic crisis]], with [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock]] in [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly|parliament]] crippling the government's ability to manage Bolivia's financial woes. Amid a faltering [[approval rating]],{{sfn|''Americas Quarterly'' 30 May 2024}} [[roadblock]]s led by Morales supporters, and rising economic protests from outside labor groups, Arce called on the Armed Forces to defend him from "sinister plans that seek a [[soft coup]] or to shorten [his] term".{{sfn|''El País'' 30 May 2024}}

== Coup attempt ==
=== Prelude and early maneuvering ===
Two days before the coup, on the night of 24 June, General [[Juan José Zúñiga]], the [[commanding general]] of the [[Bolivian Army|Army]], declared on the [[Red PAT|PAT network]] that if Morales attempted to run for president again, the Armed Forces would seek to arrest him. "That man cannot be president of this country again", Zúñiga affirmed. "If the case warrants it, I think that yes [we would arrest him]".{{sfn|Noticias Fides 25 June 2024|loc={{"'}}Ese señor no puede volver a ser más presidente de este país', resaltó Zúñiga{{nbsp}}... 'Si el caso amerita, yo creo que sí [lo detendríamos]{{'"}}}} The general's comments provoked a wave of criticism from supporters of Morales and [[Opposition (politics)|the opposition]],{{sfn|''La Razón'' 26 June 2024}} and by the next day, sources consulted by ''[[El Deber]]'' claimed that Zúñiga had been relieved of command.{{sfn|''El Deber'' 25 June 2024}} He denied that narrative, however, stating to radio ERBOL that he was "still the commander [of the Army]" and that rumors of his dismissal were untrue.{{sfn|''El Día'' 26 June 2024|loc={{"'}}Yo sigo todavía de comandante [del Ejército]{{nbsp}}...' acotó"}}

By the morning of 26 June, the situation surrounding Zúñiga's apparent removal remained unclear, with the general participating in an official military event, where he granted ranks to new members of the Army Intelligence Branch.{{sfn|ERBOL 26 June 2024}} According to Defense Minister [[Edmundo Novillo]], Zúñiga had indeed been sacked the night prior, in a private meeting described as "most friendly [and] with hugs".{{sfn|PBS News 28 June 2024}} By 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m. [[UTC−04:00|BOT]], however, unofficial reports indicated a level of discontent within the Armed Forces over the fact that Zúñiga had still not made his official resignation available to the president,{{sfn|''El Deber'' 27 June 2024}} and sometime thereafter, he was summoned to government headquarters to be formally relieved of his post.{{sfn|''El Deber'' 26 June 2024}}

Around 9:00{{nbsp}}a.m., reports began trickling into the [[Ministry of Defense (Bolivia)|Ministry of Defense]] of troops being mobilized in six trucks, which Novillo thought was "not normal".{{sfn|''The Washington Post'' 26 June 2024}} At twelve noon, he called to inform Arce that Zúñiga could not be contacted and that several military units were approaching [[La Paz]]. The president, who was at an event in [[El Alto]], made his return to the [[Casa Grande del Pueblo]]{{snd}}the [[presidential palace]]{{snd}}where he met with Vice President [[David Choquehuanca]] and convened [[Cabinet of Bolivia|his cabinet]].{{sfn|SWI swissinfo 28 June 2024}}

=== Capture of the Plaza Murillo ===
Finally, at about half past two in the afternoon, armed troops began seizing control of [[Plaza Murillo]], the political center of Bolivia, where both the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches are headquartered.{{sfn|ABI 26 June 2024}} They were followed by a contingent of [[military vehicle]]s.{{sfn|UNITEL 26 June 2024}}  [[María Nela Prada]], minister of the presidency, recalled that Arce learned of the uprising when he inquired about sirens outside. "I go to the window and see military tanks taking over [the plaza]", she said.{{sfn|''The Washington Post'' 26 June 2024}} Below, [[Eduardo del Castillo]], minister of government, emerged from the palace to confront a vehicle parked at the gate. "Demobilize now!", he shouted as he banged on the car window.{{sfn|UNITEL 26 June 2024}} He then returned inside and informed the president that Zúñiga was in one of the cars.{{sfn|SWI swissinfo 28 June 2024}}

From [[social media]], Arce quickly denounced the "irregular mobilizations" and urged that democracy be respected.{{sfn|Anadolu Agency 26 June 2024}} Around the same time, he also contacted Morales to warn him of the coup d'état underway. Morales later stated the president "was nervous" during their two-minute conversation and claimed that he confronted Arce for both promoting Zúñiga and not removing him earlier.{{sfn|Noticias Fides 28 June 2024}} Later on, Morales also took to social media to [[Mass mobilization|mobilize]] supporters against the coup.{{sfn|Anadolu Agency 26 June 2024}}

As the coup unfolded, Zúñiga arrived on the scene and began directing comments to reporters. "The three chiefs of the Armed Forces have come to express our dismay", he declared. Flanked by soldiers, the general assured that the military would "restore democracy" and insisted that their actions had popular support. "We are listening to the cry of the people", he affirmed, "look at what situation we are in, what crisis [the elite] have left us in".{{sfn|ABC News 26 June 2024}}{{sfn|''USA Today'' 26 June 2024}} Zúñiga went on to state that he would continue to recognize Arce as president "for now" but that there needed to be a new [[Cabinet of Bolivia|cabinet of ministers]] and the release of [[political prisoner]]s.{{sfn|Al Jazeera 26 June 2024}} Minutes later, at 3:49{{nbsp}}p.m., an armored vehicle rammed the [[façade]] of the [[Palacio Quemado]]{{snd}}the historical palace of government{{snd}}destroying the main gate.{{sfn|''El Deber'' 27 June 2024}}{{sfn|''NACLA Report'' 28 June 2024}} Masked soldiers led by Zúñiga proceeded to storm the entrance while yet more troops closed off the perimeter.{{sfn|''El Deber'' 27 June 2024}}{{sfn|''USA Today'' 26 June 2024}}

{{External media |float=right |width=300px |topic=Arce confronts Zúñiga |headerimage=[[File:National Cockade of Bolivia.svg|alt=Bolivian national cockade|x40px|left]] |caption="In an extraordinary scene that would not have been out of place in a [[telenovela]], President Arce faced down the leader of the so-called coup plot".{{sfn|''NACLA Report'' 28 June 2024}} |video1=[https://archive.org/details/discusion-entre-presidente-arce-y-general-zuniga  Discusión acalorada entre el presidente Luis Arce y el general Juan José Zúñiga]}}

In a tense exchange inside the building, Arce confronted Zúñiga face-to-face, demanding the military return to its barracks: "...{{nbsp}}you are carrying out a coup against the Bolivian people! I will not allow it! If you respect yourself as a soldier, withdraw all your forces. It's an order!". Amid shouting, Arce asked if Zúñiga was "going to listen to [him]?". The general{{snd}}surrounded by soldiers and flanked by the heads of the [[Bolivian Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Bolivian Navy|Navy]], Marcelo Zegarra and Juan Arnez{{snd}}replied with a stern, "no". Arce then directed the same question to the other two commanding officers. Arnez echoed, "no", but Zegarra said, "yes". Footage of the event displayed Zúñiga leaving the building shortly thereafter.{{sfn|''Correo del Sur'' 27 June 2024|loc="¡Cuidado estés haciendo un golpe contra el pueblo boliviano! ¡No te lo voy a permitir! Si usted se respeta como militar, repliegue a todas sus fuerzas. ¡Es una orden general!"}}

Zúñiga emerged from the Palacio Quemado shortly after 4:00{{nbsp}}p.m. "We are withdrawing", he stated before boarding an idling vehicle, which transported him out of the plaza. Nonetheless, the siege remained in place as soldiers faced down [[Law enforcement in Bolivia|law enforcement]] who attempted to dislodge them using [[tear gas]].{{sfn|''Los Tiempos'' 26 June 2024}}{{sfn|''La Razón'' 27 June 2024}} The police corps hadn't joined the uprising;{{sfn|''The New York Times'' 27 June 2024}} although Police Chief Alvaro Álvarez was informed of the coup plot by its commanders, he had declined to participate.{{sfn|SWI swissinfo 28 June 2024}} The coup, by now, had started to stall, a fact Zúñiga later attributed to the delay of units arriving from [[Viacha]] and the lack of Air Force support.{{sfn|Yahoo! News 27 June 2024}}

=== Resolution and military withdrawal ===
Back inside the palace, the only commander yet remaining was Zegarra, who{{snd}}depending on the narrative{{snd}}either faltered at the last minute or was unaware of the military's ultimate objective from the start.{{sfn|''Correo del Sur'' 27 June 2024}}{{sfn|''El Deber'' 29 June 2024}} Zegarra accompanied Arce back to the Casa Grande, where they held a short meeting.{{sfn|''El Deber'' 29 June 2024}} "I insisted that he reflect [on] the consequences that could come", the president recounted.{{sfn|SWI swissinfo 28 June 2024|loc="[Arce] encaró a Zegarra, de la fuerza Aérea. 'Él dubitó y le insistí en que reflexione y que vea las consecuencias que podían llegar{{'"}}}} Minutes later, Arce released a short video from his office, where he urged the populace to "mobilize against the coup d'état".{{sfn|''El País'' 27 June 2024|loc="Rodeado por sus ministros, [Arce] señalaba: 'Necesitamos que el pueblo se movilice contra el golpe de Estado{{'"}}}} By that point, the [[Bolivian Workers' Center]]{{snd}}the largest [[trade union]] in the country{{snd}}had declared an indefinite nationwide [[general strike]] and called on labor groups to march on La Paz in defense of the government.{{sfn|Noticias Fides 26 June 2024}} Around the same time, the crowd of protesters already forming outside the plaza was repressed by tear gas fire,{{sfn|''La Razón'' 27 June 2024}} leaving at least twelve injured.{{sfn|''The New York Times'' 27 June 2024}}

As chaos reigned on the streets outside, the president hastily convened a ceremony to appoint new chiefs of the three armed forces. "Over the booming of tear gas being fired at pro-democracy protesters",{{sfn|''The Economist'' 27 June 2024}} Arce swore in [[José Wilson Sánchez]], Renán Ramírez, and Gerardo Zavala as heads of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, respectively. The commanding officer of the Armed Forces, Gonzalo Vigabriel, was implicitly ratified in his position, having remained loyal throughout the coup.{{sfn|''El País'' 27 June 2024}} Sánchez then took to the stand and ordered all mobilized units to return to their barracks. Armored vehicles occupying the plaza pulled out within minutes, followed by several hundred soldiers. Police in riot gear quickly moved to cordon off the area around the palace.{{sfn|ABC News 26 June 2024}} "Almost as suddenly as they had arrived, the soldiers left", said ''[[The Economist]]''.{{sfn|''The Economist'' 27 June 2024}} In all, the botched putsch lasted around three hours.{{sfn|''The Hill'' 26 June 2024}}

As the military threat subsided, crowds of supporters filled the plaza square in celebration, singing and waving flags.{{sfn|ABC News 26 June 2024}} From the balcony of the Casa Grande, Arce addressed cheering supporters, saying "the only ones who can remove us from here are you"{{sfn|''The Washington Post'' 26 June 2024}} and shouting "Long live democracy".{{sfn|Al Jazeera 26 June 2024}}

== Reactions ==
=== Domestic ===
Former presidents [[Carlos Mesa]] and [[Jorge Quiroga]] condemned the coup, stressing that the government could only be removed through the ballot box. Despite Zúñiga's overtures towards the release of political prisoners,{{sfn|''El Diario'' 27 June 2024}} both [[Jeanine Áñez]] and [[Luis Fernando Camacho]]{{snd}}each incarcerated for their roles in the 2019 crisis{{snd}}also repudiated the military's actions. Journalist Angus McNelly reported that "everyone was apparently against Zúñiga".{{sfn|''NACLA Report'' 28 June 2024}}

President Luis Arce condemned the coup and called for public support, while former President Evo Morales demanded criminal charges against the coup plotters. Allies swiftly condemned the coup, and concerns arose about potential crackdowns on political opponents.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Grant |first1=Will |date=27 June 2024 |title=Bolivian police arrest leader of apparent coup attempt |work=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c288eewr1wko |access-date=30 June 2024 |archive-date=27 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240627000701/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c288eewr1wko |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 30 June, Morales denounced Arce, alleging that it was a self-coup to boost his popularity. He also apologised for expressing support for Arce during the coup, and called for an independent investigation. In response, [[María Nela Prada]] told him to not "become a puppet, a marionette and an instrument of imperialism".<ref>{{cite news|last=Janetsky|first=Megan|title=Bolivian president orchestrated a 'self-coup,' political rival Evo Morales claims|url=https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-coup-accusation-arce-morales-b0051f5a98fdd7ec5ba212bbe49d9850|work=[[Associated Press News]]|date=2024-06-30|access-date=30 June 2024|archive-date=30 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240630231938/https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-coup-accusation-arce-morales-b0051f5a98fdd7ec5ba212bbe49d9850|url-status=live}}</ref>
