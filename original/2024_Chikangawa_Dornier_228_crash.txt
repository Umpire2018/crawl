== Accident ==
The aircraft disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Lilongwe, with aviation officials unable to contact the aircraft.

== Aftermath ==
The remains of the victims were transported to Lilongwe aboard a [[Zambian Air Force]] helicopter on 11 June. President Chakwera subsequently declared 21 days of [[national mourning]] beginning on 11 June and said that Chilima would be accorded a [[state funeral]].<ref name="mourning">{{Cite web |date=11 June 2024 |title=Malawi announces state funeral and 21 days of mourning for vice president killed in a plane crash |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/ |access-date=12 June 2024 |website=Africanews |archive-date=12 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240612134536/https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/ |url-status=live}}</ref> 

A service was held for Chilima at the [[Bingu National Stadium]] in Lilongwe on 16 June, during which at least 41,000 people attended.

==Investigation==
Chakwera called for an independent investigation into the crash, saying that the Malawi Defence Force cannot conduct an investigation "that can be credible on its own".<ref name="apfuneral"/> Government spokesperson [[Moses Kunkuyu]] announced that the [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation]] (BFU) would investigate the accident with a representative of [[General Atomics]] also joining the investigation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lameck |last=Masina |title=German experts to investigate Malawi vice president's plane crash |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/german-experts-to-investigate-malawi-vice-president-s-plane-crash-/7669925.html |access-date=4 September 2024 |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=25 June 2024 |archive-date=4 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240904065515/https://www.voanews.com/a/german-experts-to-investigate-malawi-vice-president-s-plane-crash-/7669925.html |url-status=live }}</ref> 

=== Interim report ===
On 30 August, the BFU released their interim report, finding that [[adverse weather]] conditions were a significant factor that led to the accident, with the aircraft descending into a hillside due to the pilots suffering [[spatial disorientation]] in deteriorating weather conditions. The report noted that the aircraft was equipped with neither a [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) nor a [[flight data recorder]] (FDR).<ref name="Preliminary" /><ref name="Airspace Analysis" /> Additionally, the BFU found that the aircraft's [[emergency locator transmitter]] (ELT) was non functioning because its battery had been expired since 2004. According to the [[Malawi Air Force]], there were no spare parts to replace the battery and no budget to replace the older ELT with a newer version.<ref name="Preliminary" />{{Rp|16}} Radar coverage was also found to have been insufficient with radio communications between the flight crew and [[air traffic control]]s (ATC) at [[Lilongwe Airport]] and [[Mzuzu Airport]] not having been recorded.<ref name="Preliminary" /><ref name="Airspace Analysis" />

== Reactions ==
President Chakwera said he was "deeply saddened and sorry" over the disaster and praised Chilima, describing him as a "formidable VP".<ref name="bbcfound"/> [[FIFA]] president [[Gianni Infantino]], who was in Malawi for a scheduled visit and had been due to meet with Chilima, expressed his condolences to his widow, Mary Nkhamanyachi Chilima.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 June 2024 |title=FIFA president visits Malawi for first time, offers condolences over passing of nation's VP |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/ |access-date=13 June 2024 |website=Africanews |archive-date=12 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240612134536/https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
