==Background==
The election was viewed as a referendum on the presidency of [[Azali Assoumani]], who faced opposition from five other candidates. Opposition candidates pledged to unite behind a single candidate should no candidate reach a majority of the vote in the 14 January election, which would trigger a runoff election on 25 February. The opposition candidates shared the slogan "Azali Nalawe" ("Azali, get out"). Ten days before campaigning began, Harimia Ahmed, the senior Supreme Court magistrate responsible for monitoring the elections, was dismissed through a decree by Assoumani.<ref name="lemonde">{{Cite news |date=2024-01-14 |title=In the Comoros, President Azali Assoumani is the favorite in an already disputed election |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2024/01/14/in-the-comoros-president-azali-assoumani-is-the-favorite-in-an-already-disputed-election_6429766_124.html |access-date=2024-01-15 |work=Le Monde.fr |language=en |archive-date=15 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240115001911/https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2024/01/14/in-the-comoros-president-azali-assoumani-is-the-favorite-in-an-already-disputed-election_6429766_124.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Assoumani campaigned on the slogan "Gwa Ndzima" ("knock out in one go"), signaling his intent to win an outright majority in the first round. He pledged to continue his ongoing projects such as increased infrastructure, turning the country into a [[Tourism in the Comoros|tourist destination]] and raising Comoros' international profile through his assumption of the rotating presidency of the [[African Union]]. He also blamed the "[[COVID-19 pandemic in the Comoros|coronavirus crisis]]" for adversely affecting his track record.<ref name="lemonde"/>

==Electoral system==
Until 2018, the [[List of heads of state of the Comoros|presidency]] of the Comoros rotated between the country's three main islands: [[Anjouan]], [[Grande Comore]] and [[Mohéli]]. The [[2010 Comorian presidential election|2010 elections]] were limited to Mohélian candidates and the [[2016 Comorian presidential election|2016 elections]], which were tainted by violence and allegations of irregularities, saw candidates from Grande Comore contest the elections.<ref>[http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/comoros/government Comoros: Government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122223110/http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/comoros/government |date=22 November 2020 }} Global Edge</ref><ref name="win"/> The next presidential election would have seen a president elected from Anjouan.

However, a [[2018 Comorian constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] in July 2018 saw voters approve constitutional amendments that scrapped the rotation system and instituted a standard [[two-round system]] in which a candidate has to receive a majority of the vote in the first round to be elected, with a second round held if no candidate is able to win in the first round.<ref name=G>[https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/189551/comoros-presidential-elections-scheduled-for-march-2019 Comoros: Presidential elections scheduled for March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928074220/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/189551/comoros-presidential-elections-scheduled-for-march-2019 |date=28 September 2020 }} Garda World, 31 December 2018</ref> The changes also moved the next presidential elections forward to 2019 and allowed incumbent President [[Azali Assoumani]] to run for another term.<ref>[https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Africa-top-trouble-spots-in-2019-mapped/4552908-4923110-2sit6rz/index.html Africa's top trouble spots in 2019 mapped] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200911182904/https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Africa-top-trouble-spots-in-2019-mapped/4552908-4923110-2sit6rz/index.html |date=11 September 2020 }} The East African, 6 January 2019</ref>

The referendum led to [[2018–2019 Comoran protests|violent protests and an armed uprising in Anjouan in October 2018]], which was stopped by the [[Comorian Armed Forces|military]] after several days.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/comoros-army-regains-control-in-anjouan-after-uprising-minister-20181021 Comoros army regains control in Anjouan after uprising: minister] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616003106/https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/comoros-army-regains-control-in-anjouan-after-uprising-minister-20181021 |date=2019-06-16}} News 24, 21 October 2018</ref>

==Results==
On 16 January 2024 Idrissa Said Ben Ahmada, the head of the Comorian election commission, announced that Assoumani had received 63% of the vote, precluding a run-off. His nearest rival, [[Salim Issa Abdillah]], received 20%. However, the commission noted that only 55,258 voters had voted in the presidential election, which was boycotted by some opposition candidates, a turnout of just 16%. The commission also said that 189,497 voters voted in the concurrent gubernatorial elections for each of the country's three islands. <ref name="BBC">{{Cite news |title=Comoros President Azali Assoumani wins fourth term in disputed poll |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68002934 |website=BBC |date=17 January 2024 |access-date=20 January 2024 |archive-date=20 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120010831/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68002934 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="win">{{Cite web |date=January 16, 2023 |title=Ex-coup leader Azali Assoumani wins re-election in disputed Comoros presidential vote |url=https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240116-ex-coup-leader-azali-assoumani-wins-re-election-in-disputed-comoros-presidential-vote |access-date=January 18, 2023 |website=France 24 |archive-date=18 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240118155353/https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240116-ex-coup-leader-azali-assoumani-wins-re-election-in-disputed-comoros-presidential-vote |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 18, 2023 |title=Comoros street protests over president's disputed re-election turn deadly |url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240118-comoros-street-protests-over-president-s-disputed-re-election-turn-deadly |access-date=January 18, 2023 |website=France 24 |archive-date=18 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240118165313/https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240118-comoros-street-protests-over-president-s-disputed-re-election-turn-deadly |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Supreme Court validated the election results on 24 January.

===Post-election protests and violence===
On 17 and 18 January, violent protests broke out in the capital [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] following the announcement of Assoumani's victory, with demonstrators ransacking and burning a former minister's residence, setting the car of an incumbent minister on fire, looting the national food depot and blocking roads.

Reacting to the violence, [[Volker Türk]], the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], urged Comoran authorities to "ensure a safe environment, where all Comorans, including members of the political opposition, can freely express their views and exercise their right to peaceful assembly," as well as to release arbitrary detainees, investigate human rights violations in the pre-election period and bring the perpetrators to justice.<ref name="unrest"/> The US embassy said that the official election results "raised serious concerns that must be addressed to maintain the peace and the well-being of the nation", and called on the electoral commission and Comorian authorities "to ensure full transparency and clarify the results it announced."<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 19, 2023 |title=US Urges Comoros To Clarify Disputed Election Results |url=https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-comoros-to-clarify-disputed-election-results-5421786f |access-date=January 19, 2023 |website=Barron's |archive-date=19 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240119175014/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-comoros-to-clarify-disputed-election-results-5421786f |url-status=live }}</ref>
