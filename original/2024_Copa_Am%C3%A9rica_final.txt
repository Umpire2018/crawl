=== Summary ===
In the first minute of the game, [[Gonzalo Montiel]] set [[Julián Álvarez]] in Colombia's penalty spot but he shot the ball wide. Apart from that action, the first 15 minutes of the game were dominated by Colombia, which retained possession of the ball and looked more threatening, which was proved in the 5th minute when [[Luis Díaz (footballer, born 1997)|Luís Díaz]] made a shot on [[Emiliano Martínez]] right post which he saved. One minute after this action, [[Santiago Arias]] sent a long ball on the right side to [[James Rodríguez]], who headed the ball to [[Jhon Córdoba]], who controlled the ball inside the box and made a shot that hit Emiliano Martinez right post and went outside. In the 12th minute, a Colombia corner kick was headed by [[Carlos Cuesta (footballer)|Carlos Cuesta]], but Emiliano Martínez caught the ball before anyone could made a shot on goal. At this point of the game, Argentina had to "cool" the game down to slow Colombia's intensity, which was being very offensive and both wingers were giving problems to the fullbacks.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Cristofanelli |first=Federico |date=July 15, 2024 |title=El boletín de calificaciones de Argentina en la final ante Colombia: los puntos superlativos que maquillaron la baja de Messi y Lautaro Martínez héroe |url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes/2024/07/15/el-boletin-de-calificaciones-de-argentina-en-la-final-ante-colombia-los-puntos-superlativos-que-maquillaron-la-baja-de-messi-y-lautaro-martinez-heroe/ |access-date=July 23, 2024 |website=Infobae}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=July 15, 2024 |title=Video resumen, gol y polémicas de Colombia vs. Argentina en final de Copa América 2024 |url=https://www.marca.com/co/2024/07/15/669497f146163f0a748b4571.html |access-date=July 23, 2024 |website=Marca}}</ref> In the 20th minute, [[Ángel Di María]] attacked from the left and sent the ball to the box for [[Lionel Messi]] to find it, which shot on target but Álvarez unintentionally blocked the shot and changed his direction and power, thus letting [[Camilo Vargas]] pick the ball calmly. Córdoba was [[Yellow card (football)|booked]] in the 27th minute after a foul on [[Lisandro Martínez]] in Argentina's box. In the 33th minute, [[Jefferson Lerma]] attempted a long-range shot to Emiliano Martinez's right post, but he managed to fingertip it to the corner kick.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In an Argentinean offensive action 2 minutes later, Messi dribbled from the left side and into Colombia's box marked by Santiago Arias, which prevented the cross. In the same action, Messi twisted his right [[ankle]], reason for why he got to receive medical assistance immediately and had to leave the pitch a few minutes before coming back. In the 44th minute, a foul on [[Nicolás Tagliafico]] by Santiago Arias resulted in a free kick, which Lionel Messi crossed into the box and was headed by Tagliafico himself, but it went above the crossbar. After one minute of added time, the first half ended with a 0-0 draw.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=July 16, 2024 |title=El detrás de escena de la lesión de Messi y la atención especial que recibió en el entretiempo para seguir jugando la final: "Tenía el tobillo a la miseria" |url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes/2024/07/17/el-detras-de-escena-de-la-lesion-de-messi-y-la-atencion-especial-que-recibio-en-el-entretiempo-para-seguir-jugando-la-final-tenia-el-tobillo-a-la-miseria/ |access-date=July 23, 2024 |website=Infobae}}</ref>

Shortly after the start of the second half, James Rodríguez crossed the ball into the box from the left and Córdoba headed it to Santiago Arias, who attempted a shot but it went wide. Two minutes later, Álvarez put a through ball into the box for [[Alexis Mac Allister]] who, after trying to go around the keeper, passed the ball to Di María who shot directly into Vargas, who saved it. In the 58th minute, Di María received the ball from Tagliafico in three-quarters and started dribbling his way from the left into the box and right before falling he shot, forcing a save by Vargas and a corner kick in favour of Argentina. In the 61st minute, Mac Allister was booked after a foul on James Rodríguez.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

One minute after this action, Messi attempted a run after Díaz, when he suddenly fell and immediately asked for a substitution. Even though the medical assistance entered the pitch and tried to make him recover, Messi was unable to step firmly and had to be substituted by [[Nicolás González (footballer, born 1998)|Nicolás González]]. When he got walked off the pitch with assistance, the Argentinean crowd in the stadium started [[chant]]ing his name and he was seen crying in the bench after being subbed off.<ref name=":2" /> Argentina started being more offensive after Messi's substitution and González entry, since he started exploiting the Colombia free spaces behind the defensive line and making runs through the left wing.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Shortly after, another injury had to force [[Lionel Scaloni]] to make a substitution, when Montiel disputed a ball and fell injured, forcing him to leave the pitch and [[Nahuel Molina]] had to replace him. González entry almost paid off in the 74th minute, when a through ball by [[Enzo Fernández]] to Tagliafico was crossed into the box for González to put it into the back of the net, but the goal was immediately ruled off because of Tagliafico being [[Offside (association football)|offside]] in the previous action.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> In the 87th minute, Di María sent a high cross into the box which González head-crossed to Álvarez, who nearly connected the ball, but failing to do so. After 4 minutes of added time and still in a 0-0 draw, the game went into [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra-time]]. Before this, [[Néstor Lorenzo|Nestor Lorenzo]] made up two substitutions before the start of the extra-time, taking off Jhon Córdoba and [[Richard Ríos]] for [[Rafael Santos Borré]] and [[Kevin Castaño]] respectively.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />[[File:ARGENTINA VS VENEZUELA Lautaro (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lautaro Martínez]] scored the game-winning goal for Argentina.|231x231px]]
Before the start of the extra-time, Lorenzo made another substitution, bringing in [[Juan Fernando Quintero]] and taking off James Rodríguez. Argentina became dominant and had clear chances, with the most dangerous happening in the 94th minute, when [[Rodrigo De Paul]] made a run down the right and made a rasant cross to González, who shot on goal but Vargas saved it in the goal line. Two minutes after this action, Scaloni made a triple substitution, taking Julián Álvarez, Enzo Fernández and Alexis Mac Allister off the pitch and bringing on [[Lautaro Martínez]], [[Giovani Lo Celso]], and [[Leandro Paredes]] respectively. Colombia recovered a little bit of intensity in the final minutes of the first half of extra-time and made attacking efforts with runs from Quintero and [[Jhon Arias (footballer)|Jhon Arias]] or crosses from [[Johan Mojica]] but were contained by [[Cristian Romero (Argentine footballer)|Cristian Romero]], Lisandro Martínez and Paredes. One minute was added and the first half of extra-time ended.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Before the start of the second half, Lorenzo used his last window and [[Miguel Borja]], [[Jorge Carrascal]] and [[Mateus Uribe]] entered the pitch, subbing Luís Díaz, Jhon Arias and Jefferson Lerma off. In the 107th minute Di María advanced from the right and crossed the ball into the box, Lautaro Martínez nearly touched it, but couldn't reach. One minute after this action, Miguel Borja received a through ball while being onside and alone into the box and shot at the left post of Emiliano Martinez, but Lisandro Martinez appeared from behind and blocked the shot for a corner. In the 112th minute, the three substitutions made early in the extra-time by Scaloni paid off, when a counter-attack by Kevin Castaño was cut by Paredes as he recovered the ball in the midfield and passed the ball to Lo Celso, who played a through ball to Lautaro Martínez and escaped [[Carlos Cuesta (footballer)|Carlos Cuesta]], shooting on goal and scoring the 1-0 for Argentina. Immediately after this, Scaloni made a defensive change and took off Ángel Di María for [[Nicolás Otamendi]]. After the goal, the match got heated and both Miguel Borja and Giovani Lo Celso received yellow cards. After two minutes of added time in which Colombia attacked mainly with cross balls, the match ended with an Argentina victory.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
