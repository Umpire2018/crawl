* In the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]], the length of [[array (data type)|arrays]] must be treated and checked separately. However, the length was not checked before access. An array with 21 fields was expected, but the channel file was in an older data format with only 20 fields.
* In the [[unit test]]s, only the ''[[happy path]]'' was tested. [[Regression test]]s for [[backward compatibility|compatibility]] with the older data format were not conducted.
* In manual tests, only valid data was tested.
* The channel files did not contain a version number field that was checked.
* There were no staggered [[software deployment|rollouts]], but the update was distributed to all customers simultaneously. Even [[critical infrastructure]] was not specially treated.
* The software does not access the system on [[Microsoft Windows]] through a suitable [[application programming interface]] but runs as a [[device driver|driver]] in [[protection ring|ring 0]] to have elevated privileges on the [[operating system]]. However, a crash in this area leads to a [[blue screen of death]], which stops the operating system.

===CrowdStrike liability===
CrowdStrike's own [[Contractual term|terms]] and conditions for their Falcon software limit [[Liability (financial accounting)|liability]] to "fees paid", effectively a refund.

In the EU, it is possible that CrowdStrike will be held liable under a [[GDPR]] regulation related to the impact of security incidents on user data. The regulation is best known in relation to [[data leak]]s but also applies to [[data loss|data destruction]]. It is unclear whether temporary loss of access to data is enough to trigger liability, or whether GDPR applies to all incidents related to security or only unauthorised access.<ref name=CSC-1>{{cite web |last1=Stokel-Walker |first1=Chris |title=CrowdStrike could have a European-size data problem on its hands |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/91160759/crowdstrike-data-gdpr |website=Fast Company |access-date=23 July 2024 |date=23 July 2024 |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725185312/https://www.fastcompany.com/91160759/crowdstrike-data-gdpr |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Cyber criminals]] started sending phishing emails purporting to be CrowdStrike support and impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls shortly afterward.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Warning issued about phishing attacks post global tech outage |url=https://www.intelligentciso.com/2024/07/22/warning-issued-about-phishing-attacks-post-global-tech-outage/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240725061306/https://www.intelligentciso.com/2024/07/22/warning-issued-about-phishing-attacks-post-global-tech-outage/ |archive-date=25 July 2024 |access-date=22 July 2024 |website=Intelligent CISO |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=22 July 2024 |title=Microsoft-Crowdstrike IT outage triggers wave of phishing attacks |url=https://www.techcircle.in/2024/07/22/microsoft-crowdstrike-it-outage-triggers-wave-of-phishing-attacks |access-date=22 July 2024 |website=Techcircle |language=en |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725201051/https://www.techcircle.in/2024/07/22/microsoft-crowdstrike-it-outage-triggers-wave-of-phishing-attacks |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-28 |title=CERT-In says global outage being leveraged to launch phishing attacks against CrowdStrike users |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cert-in-global-outage-leveraged-launch-phishing-attacks-crowdstrike-9481265/ |access-date=2024-07-30 |website=The Indian Express |language=en |archive-date=30 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240730090007/https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cert-in-global-outage-leveraged-launch-phishing-attacks-crowdstrike-9481265/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Analysis==
===Cause===
The 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software. This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sharwood |first=Simon |date=July 24, 2024 |title=CrowdStrike blames a test software bug for that giant global mess it made |url=https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/24/crowdstrike_preliminary_incident_report/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240724112421/https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/24/crowdstrike_preliminary_incident_report/ |archive-date=July 24, 2024 |access-date=July 24, 2024 |work=The Register}}</ref><ref name="Falcon Hub" /> The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.

=== Centralisation and homogeneity ===
The outage raised questions about [[oligopoly]] and centralisation in the information technology sector.<ref name="IT out">{{cite news |last=Clarke |first=Tom |date=19 July 2024 |title=Serious questions to answer after what could be the biggest IT outage in history |url=https://news.sky.com/story/microsoft-has-serious-questions-to-answer-after-what-could-be-the-biggest-it-outage-in-history-13180962 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240719143114/https://news.sky.com/story/microsoft-has-serious-questions-to-answer-after-what-could-be-the-biggest-it-outage-in-history-13180962 |archive-date=19 July 2024 |access-date=25 July 2024 |work=Sky News |language=en}}</ref><ref name="centralisation">{{cite news |date=19 July 2024 |title=Major Microsoft outage: Numerous sectors hit in worldwide "Digital Pandemic" |url=https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/major-microsoft-outage-numerous-sectors-hit-in-worldwide-digital-pandemic/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240725021054/https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/major-microsoft-outage-numerous-sectors-hit-in-worldwide-digital-pandemic/ |archive-date=25 July 2024 |access-date=21 July 2024 |work=Open Access Government}}</ref> The majority of the world's computers use Microsoft Windows, creating a monoculture that reduces resiliency.<ref name="CBC" /><ref name="centralisation" /> [[Ciaran Martin]], a cybersecurity expert, said, "This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world's core internet infrastructure".<ref name="CBC" /> Critical infrastructure expert [[Gregory Falco]] said, "Cybersecurity providers are part of this homogenous backbone of modern systems and are so core to how we operate that a glitch in their operations will have similar impacts to failures in systems that are household names".<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 July 2024 |title=What experts are saying about the massive CrowdStrike global tech outage |url=https://qz.com/crowdstrike-global-tech-outage-experts-1851600081 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240725021531/https://qz.com/google-failed-wiz-acquisition-microsoft-cybersecurity-d-1851602292 |archive-date=25 July 2024 |access-date=21 July 2024 |website=Quartz |language=en}}</ref> Security experts suggested more [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] to avoid [[single points of failure]],<ref name="IT out" /> wider use of decentralised and heterogeneous [[Federation (information technology)|federated]] systems,<ref name="centralisation" /> and public anger at the failure of political leaders to regulate for diversity and competition.<ref name="CBC" /> Conversely, cybersecurity expert Andrew Plato argued that monocultures are a net positive, “from a security perspective, there’s actually a lot of benefits to running a smaller, standardized set of software, because it allows you to spot a problem quicker and easier."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Stephanie |date=22 July 2024 |title=When businesses run standardized software, small problems can quickly grow |url=https://www.marketplace.org/2024/07/22/when-businesses-run-standardized-software-small-problems-can-quickly-grow/ | access-date=21 October 2024 | work=Marketplace |language=en}}</ref>

===IT practices===
Experts speculate that the update was not put through routine [[patch management]] procedures (testing the update in a [[Sandbox (software development)|sandbox]]) to verify there were no problems.<ref>{{cite web |author=Zeba Siddiqui |date=20 July 2024 |title=CrowdStrike update that caused global outage likely skipped checks, experts say |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/crowdstrike-update-that-caused-global-outage-likely-skipped-checks-experts-say-2024-07-20/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240720132659/https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/crowdstrike-update-that-caused-global-outage-likely-skipped-checks-experts-say-2024-07-20/ |archive-date=20 July 2024 |access-date=21 July 2024 |website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

===Operating system design and antitrust enforcement===
Microsoft blamed a 2009 antitrust agreement with the [[European Union]] that they said forced them to sustain low-level [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] access to third-party developers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hale |first=Craig |date=22 July 2024 |title=Microsoft blames EU rules for its inability to lock down Windows following CrowdStrike incident |url=https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/microsoft-blames-eu-rules-for-its-inability-to-lock-down-windows-following-crowdstrike-incident |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240723180444/https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/microsoft-blames-eu-rules-for-its-inability-to-lock-down-windows-following-crowdstrike-incident |archive-date=23 July 2024 |access-date=22 July 2024 |website=Tech Radar}}</ref><ref name="HillPaul-Neowin">{{Cite web |last=Hill |first=Paul |date=21 July 2024 |title=Microsoft points finger at the EU for not being able to lock down Windows |url=https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-points-finger-at-the-eu-for-not-being-able-to-lock-down-windows/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240722045312/https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-points-finger-at-the-eu-for-not-being-able-to-lock-down-windows/ |archive-date=22 July 2024 |access-date=22 July 2024 |website=Neowin}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=21 July 2024 |title=Blue Screens Everywhere Are Latest Tech Woe for Microsoft |url=https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240722123824/https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90 |archive-date=22 July 2024 |access-date=22 July 2024 |website=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> The document does not explicitly state that Microsoft has to provide kernel-level access, but says Microsoft must provide access to the same APIs used by its own security products.<ref name="HillPaul-Neowin" /> The EU rejected the allegations. The European Commission spokesperson told Euronews that "Microsoft is free to decide on its business model. It is for Microsoft to adapt its security infrastructure to respond to threats in line with EU competition law. Additionally, consumers are free to benefit from competition and choose between different cybersecurity providers."

The spokesperson also said that "the incident was not limited to the European Union and that Microsoft has never raised any concerns about security with the Commission either before or after the incident."<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 July 2024 |title=Video.

In Linux, it is possible to use [[eBPF]] instead of [[kernel module]]s to program this type of software.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harper |first=Christopher |date=22 July 2024 |title=CrowdStrike issues go beyond Windows: company's security software has reportedly been causing Linux kernel panics since at least April |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/crowdstrike-issues-go-beyond-windows-companys-security-software-has-reportedly-been-causing-kernel-panics-since-at-least-april |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240725053928/https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/crowdstrike-issues-go-beyond-windows-companys-security-software-has-reportedly-been-causing-kernel-panics-since-at-least-april |archive-date=25 July 2024 |access-date=25 July 2024 |website=Tom's Hardware}}</ref>

Since [[macOS Catalina]] (2019), this type of software can use the ''Endpoint Security Framework'' instead of a kernel extension, and this approach has been gradually enforced.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chambers |first=Bradley |date=20 July 2024 |title=Apple @ Work: How Apple protects the Mac from mass enterprise outages |url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/20/lets-talk-about-apples-endpoint-security-framework/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240725053542/https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/20/lets-talk-about-apples-endpoint-security-framework/ |archive-date=25 July 2024 |access-date=25 July 2024 |website=9to5Mac}}</ref>
