On 19 May 2024, an attempted [[coup d'état]] took place in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2024-05-19 |title=Congolese army says shootout in the capital is failed coup, perpetrators arrested |url=https://apnews.com/article/congo-kinshasa-gunfire-1a148e35f0cbbae14b2101413f788708 |access-date=2024-05-19 |website=AP News|first1=Christina|last1=Malkia|first2=Chinedu|last2=Asadu |language=en |archive-date=2024-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240519105259/https://apnews.com/article/congo-kinshasa-gunfire-1a148e35f0cbbae14b2101413f788708 |url-status=live }}</ref> Targeting President [[Félix Tshisekedi]] and his Economy Minister [[Vital Kamerhe]], the assailants attacked both the [[Palais de la Nation (Kinshasa)|Palais de la Nation]] and Kamerhe's residence. They were heavily armed and put up an intense fight at the Kamerhe home. At least one shell from the fighting detonated in the nearby capital of the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Brazzaville]], causing several injuries.{{cn|date=February 2025}} 

The coup attempt was foiled quickly by the security forces. The orchestrator of the coup was [[Christian Malanga]], a Congolese native who lived in the United States as a political asylee. Malanga founded a US-registered party, the [[United Congolese Party]], in 2010, Then in 2017, in Belgium, he proclaimed himself head of the [[New Zaire (government in exile)|New Zaire Government in Exile]], referring to himself as ''president''. He was killed during the attempted coup. His son and two other American nationals were captured, tried and sentenced to death as part of a group of more than 50 people, but were repatriated to the United States after their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment by President Tshisekedi.

==Background==
The coup attempt occurred amid a political crisis that gripped President [[Félix Tshisekedi]]'s ruling [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|party]]. The crisis revolved around an election for the leadership of [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|parliament]], initially slated for 18 May 2024 but subsequently deferred.<ref name=":0" /> One of the targeted politicians was an ally of Tshisekedi, Economy Minister [[Vital Kamerhe]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2024-05-19 |title=RDC: situation confuse à Kinshasa autour de la résidence de Vital Kamerhe |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20240519-rdc-situation-confuse-kinshasa-r%C3%A9sidence-de-vital-kamerhe-la-gomb%C3%A9 |access-date=2024-05-19 |website=RFI |language=fr}}</ref> who was running for the [[List of presidents of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|presidency]] of the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]].<ref name="apcoup"/>

Another American, a 22-year-old [[FedEx]] worker and former [[high school football]] teammate of Thompson and Marcel Malanga, said that Marcel had offered him $50,000 to $100,000 to act as a security guard for his father for four months in the DRC; the man, who lives in Utah, declined the offer, because Marcel was vague on the details of the proposed job. Other colleagues of Marcel said that he had made various propositions to entice them to go with him to the DRC, describing the opportunity at various points as a family vacation or as a service project to build wells in impoverished communities.<ref name="APSchoenbaumSecurityJob"/>

==Trials==
Fifty-three people were formally charged with various offences related to the coup such as terrorism, murder and criminal association, some of which are capital offences. After Christian Malanga and another deceased person were removed from the list, a televised [[court-martial]] for the remaining 51 suspects, including Marcel Malanga, Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, and Tyler Thompson, began at the Ndolo military prison in Kinshasa on 7 June.<ref name="verdict"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Three Americans implicated in a coup attempt in Congo go on trial before a military court |url=https://apnews.com/article/congo-kinshasa-coup-attempt-americans-trial-ef60f0d053916542575f789382437e92 |access-date=7 June 2024 |website=Associated Press |date=7 June 2024 |language=en-US |archive-date=7 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240607155321/https://apnews.com/article/congo-kinshasa-coup-attempt-americans-trial-ef60f0d053916542575f789382437e92 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the course of the trial, Marcel Malanga and Zalman-Polun said that they had been coerced by Christian Malanga to participate in the coup, adding that the latter had threatened to kill them.
