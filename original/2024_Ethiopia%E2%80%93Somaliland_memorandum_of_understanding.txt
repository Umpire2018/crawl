On 1 January 2024, a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) was signed between Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Abiy Ahmed]] and Somaliland President [[Muse Bihi Abdi]]. Reportedly, this MoU stated that [[Somaliland]] would lease {{convert|19|km|mi}} of its [[Gulf of Aden]] coastline to [[Ethiopia]] around the port city of [[Berbera]]. This agreement follows recent tensions surrounding Prime Minister Ahmed's stated desire for Ethiopia to have access to the Red Sea. In return, the MoU reportedly includes a provision stating Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland as an independent state in the future, which would make it the first [[member states of the United Nations|UN member state]] to do so.

The deal has received condemnation and opposition from [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Egypt]], with Somalia recalling its ambassador to Ethiopia in protest. Somalia previously demanded Ethiopia make a public withdrawal from the MoU before the two countries could engage in any dialogue. The dispute has also put Ethiopian participation in the new [[African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia]] (AUSSOM) in question.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mutambo |first=Aggrey |date=2024-10-27 |title=Somalia dilemma in funding next peace mission, Ethiopia fallout |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/somalia-dilemma-in-funding-next-peace-mission-ethiopia-fallout-4802720 |url-access=subscription |access-date=2024-12-28 |website=The EastAfrican |language=en |quote=Mogadishu has insisted any dialogue can only go forth if Addis Ababa publicly withdraws from the MoU and some experts say Ethiopia should rethink the deal, or redo the MoU through Mogadishu.}}</ref>

== Deal ==
On 1 January 2024, [[Ethiopia]] signed [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) with [[Somaliland]] in order to acquire access the [[Red Sea]] port. The text of the MoU was not released. President of Somaliland [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] stated that it included the lease of more than 19 kilometres of sea access around [[Berbera]] for 50 years to the [[Ethiopian Navy]]. It was also stated that the MoU included a provision for the future recognition by Ethiopia of Somaliland as a sovereign state.<ref name="bbc20240101">{{Cite news |date=2024-01-01 |title=Ethiopia signs agreement with Somaliland paving way to sea access |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67858566 |access-date=2024-01-03 |work=[[BBC News]] |language=en-GB |archive-date=2024-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240102230849/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67858566 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2023, the Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Abiy Ahmed]] described the sea access as "an existential issue for his country", with this statement leading to concerns that this implied seizing land from neighboring [[Eritrea]]. A similar 2018 deal which would have given Ethiopia a 19% stake in the port of Berbera, alongside a 51% stake going to Emirati logistics company [[DP World]] holding a 51% share, was abandoned in 2022.<ref name="bbc20240101" />

Abdi said the agreement would lead Ethiopia to set "a precedent as the first nation to extend international recognition to our country". Ethiopian politician [[Redwan Hussein]] stated that the MoU also included Somaliland taking a stake in [[Ethiopian Airlines]]. The MoU is not a legally binding agreement, which would require ratification by both parties.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 January 2024 |title=Why a Port Deal Has the Horn of Africa on Edge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/world/africa/ethiopia-somaliland-port-deal.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=3 January 2024 |archive-date=17 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817184226/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/world/africa/ethiopia-somaliland-port-deal.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Reactions ==
The [[Cabinet of Somalia]] held an emergency meeting on 2 January following the announcement of the MoU.<ref name="bbc20240101" /> Somali President [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] expressed his firm opposition to the agreement, saying Somaliland is part of Somalia under its constitution and the deal was conducted without legal basis with disdaining the rule of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[African Union|AU]], and [[IGAD]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}} He also added "Somaliland, you are the northern regions of Somalia and Ethiopia has no recognition for you. If Ethiopia claimed it gave you recognition, then it is not a recognition that exists."<ref name="reuters20240102">{{Cite web |date=3 January 2024 |title=Somalia rejects port deal between Ethiopia and Somaliland |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somalias-cabinet-calls-emergency-meet-ethiopia-somaliland-port-deal-2024-01-02/ |website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

On 3 January, Egyptian President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] held a telephone call with the Somali president, stating "Egypt will maintain a firm position alongside Somalia and support its security and stability".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-03 |title=Egypt stands firm with Somalia in face-off against Ethiopia |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/01/03/egypt-stands-firm-with-somalia-in-face-off-against-ethiopia/ |access-date=2024-01-03 |website=[[Africanews]] |language=en |archive-date=2024-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817184228/https://www.africanews.com/2024/01/03/egypt-stands-firm-with-somalia-in-face-off-against-ethiopia/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Mogadishu]] recalled its ambassador to Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-03 |title=Somalia lashes out at Ethiopia-Somaliland port deal |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/somalias-cabinet-calls-emergency-meet-on-ethiopia-somaliland-port-deal |access-date=2024-01-03 |website=[[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] |language=en}}</ref>  Somaliland Interior Minister [[Mohamed Kahin Ahmed|Mohamed Kahin]] told reporters on 2 January that "We ask Somalia to apologize for its claim that Somaliland is part of Somalia"<ref name="reuters20240102" />

She also said that issue must be handled through diplomatic dialogue and "achieve common development by having friendly cooperation."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/china-backs-somalia-in-row-with-ethiopia-about-port-deal/3106463|title=China backs Somalia in row with Ethiopia about port deal|first=Riyaz|last=ul Khaliq|newspaper=Andolu Ajansi|date=2024-01-11|access-date=2024-01-31|archive-date=2024-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817184253/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/china-backs-somalia-in-row-with-ethiopia-about-port-deal/3106463|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the wake of agreement on 3 January, the Mogadishu administration organized a rally to express opposition to the deal. Many Somali protestors chanted and held banners to express their uncertainty of the lease agreement that perceived to endanger Somalia's territory. In the rally, Somalia's Interior Minister [[Ahmed Moalim Fiqi|Ahmed Moallim Fiqi]] attended to the scene who said to protestors, "the federal government finds it unacceptable that we're ignored by an Ethiopian prime minister who belittles our federal government's role by delegitimizing it. That's a violation and unacceptable."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-04 |title=Somalis protest against Ethiopia-Somaliland deal |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/01/04/somalis-protest-against-ethiopia-somaliland-deal/ |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=Africanews |language=en |archive-date=2024-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817184214/https://www.africanews.com/2024/01/04/somalis-protest-against-ethiopia-somaliland-deal/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 11 December 2024, Ethiopia and Somalia have agreed to end their dispute over Ethiopia's plan to build a port in Somaliland, following talks brokered by Turkey. The agreement, hailed as "historic" by Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdogan]], involves both countries respecting each other's sovereignty and working towards mutually beneficial commercial arrangements for Ethiopia to access the sea "under Somalia's sovereignty." The two countries will hold further technical talks in February.<ref name="BBC ET SOM TR" /><ref name="AJ ET SOM TR" />
