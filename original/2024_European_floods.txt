Concurrently with flooding in Germany in early June, rising river levels on the Danube River reached 6.86 meters on the morning of 4 June, causing it to burst its banks in [[Linz]], submerging areas close to the river.

The flooding caused significant disruptions to the [[2024 European Parliament election in Austria|2024 European Parliament elections]], particularly in the province of [[Styria]].

[[File:Árvíz 2024.jpg|thumb|Peaking at downtown Budapest]]
Rainfall and upstream flooding from Germany and Austria caused several tidal surges along the banks of the Danube and the [[Rába]] in Hungary starting on 6 June 2024. The Danube tidal surge forced closure of the [[Budapest]] Public Road along a section of the "lower quay of Buda between Mozaik Street and [[Rákóczi Bridge]]" and a part of "the lower quay of Pest between Népfürdő Street and Közraktár Street". The "main building" of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] was closed due to elevated river levels.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mercédesz |first=Hetzmann |date=2024-06-07 |title=PHOTOS – Flooding Danube: Water level extremely high in Budapest |url=https://dailynewshungary.com/flooding-danube-water-level-budapest/ |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=Daily News Hungary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Mercédesz |first=Hetzmann |date=2024-06-06 |title=Warning: Part of Budapest closed due to rising Danube level - Daily News Hungary |url=https://dailynewshungary.com/part-of-budapest-closed-danube-level/ |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=Daily News Hungary}}</ref>

By 10 June 2024, alerts were activated along 912.4 kilometers of river sections, with the highest degree alerts in place along 10.42 kilometers of these sections. The Rába faced record water at 4.22m at [[Szentgotthárd]], initiating a third-degree flood alert and prompting the National Water Management Directorate (OVF) to mobilize over 400 staff members to build up extensive flood defense efforts, including placing 120,000 sandbags to construct a 2.5&nbsp;km flood barrier in [[Körmend]]. The Strém and [[Pinka]] rivers nearly received the monthly rainfall average in six hours, the latter recording its highest water level ever at 5.08m in [[Felsőcsatár]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2024-06-10 |title=Flooding Rába expected to peak at record level on Monday evening |url=https://dailynewshungary.com/flooding-raba-expected-to-peak-at-record-level-on-monday-evening/ |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=Daily News Hungary}}</ref>

Overflow in the Danube and Rába in turn caused several [[mosquito]] breeding sites to arise in [[Sopron]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Miskolc]], requiring the National Directorate General for Disaster Management to use biological control to prevent further spread of [[mosquito-borne disease]].<ref name="hungary 2024-06-11">{{Cite web |date=2024-06-11 |title=Danube Flooding Spurs Huge Mosquito Invasion |url=https://hungarytoday.hu/danube-flooding-spurs-huge-mosquito-invasion/ |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=Hungary Today}}</ref>
