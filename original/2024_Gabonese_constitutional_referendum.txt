A constitutional [[referendum]] was held and approved in [[Gabon]] on 16 November 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-18 |title=Journal de l'Afrique - Nouvelle constitution au Gabon, le référendum fixé au 16 novembre |url=https://www.france24.com/fr/%C3%A9missions/journal-de-l-afrique/20241018-nouvelle-constitution-au-gabon-le-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum-fix%C3%A9-au-16-novembre-prochain |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=France 24 |language=fr}}</ref> The vote was on a new [[Constitution of Gabon|constitution]];<ref>{{Cite web |title=Au Gabon, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema fixe le référendum au 16 novembre - Jeune Afrique.com |url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1622146/politique/au-gabon-brice-clotaire-oligui-nguema-fixe-le-referendum-au-16-novembre/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=JeuneAfrique.com |language=fr-FR}}</ref> it proposed, among other things, a 7-year presidential term, renewable once consecutively.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://allafrica.com/stories/202410240031.html | title=Gabon to Vote on Constitution That Would Let Military Leader Run for President | newspaper=Voice of America | date=24 October 2024 | last1=Kindzeka | first1=Moki Edwin }}</ref> The referendum may lead to the return to a civilian regime which the [[Committee for the Transition and Restoration of Institutions|military junta]] promised after the [[2023 Gabonese coup d'état|coup d'état in 2023]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-20 |title=Gabon to hold referendum on new constitution in November |url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20241020-gabon-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution-in-november |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=RFI |language=en}}</ref>

==Background==
After 56 years of leadership under [[Omar Bongo]] and his son, [[Ali Bongo]], the 2023 coup brought about military rule.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-03 |title=Gabon takes historic step towards democratic renewal |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/04/03/gabon-takes-historic-step-towards-democratic-renewal/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=Africanews |language=en}}</ref> In September 2024, a draft of the proposed new constitution was handed to transitional president [[Brice Oligui Nguema]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-01 |title=Gabon's transitional president handed draft version of future constitution |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/09/01/gabons-transitional-president-handed-draft-version-of-future-constitution/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=Africanews |language=en}}</ref> Gabon’s [[Parliament of Gabon|parliamentarians]] submitted their proposed amendments ahead of a 22 September deadline.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-17 |title=Consultations underway on Gabon's future constitution |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/09/17/consultations-underway-on-gabons-future-constitution/ |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=Africanews |language=en}}</ref>

The minister for institutional reform in Gabon, [[Murielle Minkoue Mintsa]], announced that the referendum would take place on 16 November 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 October 2024 |title=Oligui Nguema sees basic law referendum as springboard for presidential poll |url=https://www.africaintelligence.com/central-africa/2024/10/22/oligui-nguema-sees-basic-law-referendum-as-springboard-for-presidential-poll,110329383-bre |website=Africa Intelligence}}</ref>

== Constitution ==
The new constitution contains 173 articles.<ref name="aj">{{Cite web |date=2024-11-16 |title=Gabon votes in referendum on new constitution after military coup last year |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/16/gabon-votes-in-referendum-on-new-constitution-after-military-coup-last-year |access-date=2024-11-16 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref> It includes a [[presidential system]], abolishing the office of [[Prime Minister of Gabon|prime minister]], with the [[President of Gabon]] limited to two consecutive seven-year terms,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-20 |title=Gabon to hold referendum on new constitution in November |url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20241020-gabon-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution-in-november |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=RFI |language=en}}</ref> elected via the [[two-round system]]. The method of election and term of the president is [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]. The role of the prime minister would be replaced by a new "Vice President of the Government" appointed by the President (thus meaning there would be two vice presidents in total, with the other known as the Vice President of the Republic).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-24 |title=Gabon to Vote on New Constitution Okaying Military Ruler in Polls |url=https://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00090775.html |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=allAfrica.com |language=en}}</ref> The [[Languages of Gabon|working language of Gabon]] will continue to be [[French language|French]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wabwireh |first=Dominic |date=22 October 2024 |title=Key details on Gabon's new constitution and upcoming referendum |url=https://www.africanews.com/2024/10/22/key-details-on-gabons-new-constitution-and-upcoming-referendum/ |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=AfricaNews |language=en}}</ref> but it will not be considered the state's "official language".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=16 November 2024 |title=Afrique: Les Gabonais votent pour adopter ou rejeter le projet de Constitution |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20241116-les-gabonais-votent-pour-adopter-ou-rejeter-le-projet-de-constitution |access-date=2024-11-16 |website=RFI |language=fr}}</ref> [[Conscription|Mandatory military service]] would be allowed under law.<ref name=":0" /> The new constitution would also define [[Heterosexual marriage|marriage as a union between a man and a woman]] via an entrenched clause, thus permanently banning [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-24 |title=The President of Gabon Oligui Nguema wants to stay in power - Robert Lansing Institute |url=https://lansinginstitute.org/2024/10/24/the-president-of-gabon-oligui-nguema-wants-to-stay-in-power/ |access-date=2024-10-30 |language=en-US}}</ref> The national holiday of August 17 is complemented by a "liberation day" on August 30 in honor of the 2023 coup d'état.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-16 |title=Afrique Les Gabonais votent pour adopter ou rejeter le projet de Constitution |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20241116-les-gabonais-votent-pour-adopter-ou-rejeter-le-projet-de-constitution |access-date=2024-11-16 |website=Radio France International |language=fr-FR}}</ref> 

The initial insistence that "only people born to a Gabonese father and mother can run in the presidential election" was controversial among those of [[mixed heritage]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-25 |title=Gabon : pourquoi le projet de nouvelle Constitution fait débat |url=https://www.lepoint.fr/afrique/gabon-pourquoi-le-projet-de-nouvelle-constitution-fait-debat-25-10-2024-2573658_3826.php#11 |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=Le Point |language=fr}}</ref> This section was considered to prevent former [[First Lady of Gabon|first lady]] [[Sylvia Bongo Ondimba]] and her son [[Noureddin Bongo Valentin]], both of whom have dual [[France–Gabon relations|French-Gabonese nationality]], from standing.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-10-25 |title=Au Gabon, le général Brice Oligui Nguema se taille une Constitution sur mesure |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2024/10/25/au-gabon-le-general-brice-oligui-nguema-se-taille-une-constitution-sur-mesure_6359629_3212.html |access-date=2024-10-30 |language=fr}}</ref> Ultimately the requirement was amended to require a person:

* be born Gabonese to one Gabonese parent
* not possessing [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] within 3 years of standing for election
* (if applicable) have a spouse that conforms to the prior two guidelines
* have resided within the territory of Gabon for at least 3 years prior to the election
* speak at least one national language
* not be a spouse or descendant of a current President
* be physically and mentally fit
* not be in a state of having their political rights suspended

Elections for the presidency must take place within 3 months of the end of the term.

The president would be allowed to call a state of emergency, under which extra powers as defined by law would be granted to them. The president may also dissolve the [[National Assembly of Gabon|National Assembly]] once during a term after consultation with the presidents of both chambers and the [[Constitutional Court of Gabon|Constitutional Court]], provided it has been at least two years since the start of the term and that no indictment before the High Court of Justice is opened. In this case, a new election must be called within 60 days.

Members of the government must be a Gabonese citizen born to a Gabonese parent, be at least 30 years old, and not have their political rights suspended.

The National Assembly is bicameral, consisting of the National Assembly and Senate, both serving 5 year terms, with the latter being indirectly elected.{{Explain|reason=What is the mechanism for election to the senate?|date=November 2024}} Elections must take place between one and six months before the end of the term. The term of office begins on the date the Bureaux of the two chambers are elected.

The Constitutional Court would consist of 9 appointed members, plus ''ex officio'' members comprising former Presidents (provided they do not renounce that right and retain their political rights). The members serve eight year terms, with a maximum of two terms, and consist of three people appointed by the President, two each by the president of the National Assembly and Senate, and two by the High Council of the Judiciary. Re-elections would take place by members of the Court.

Wording on property ownership was included, stating that everyone has the right to property, but that "the conditions and procedures for access to property shall be determined by law", in theory enabling restrictions''.'' Cloning of human beings would be banned. Amnesty would be granted to anyone who participated in the 2023 coup d'état.

The new constitution will come into force following the [[2025 Gabonese general election|next presidential election]] if approved.

== Conduct ==
The provisional government is authorizing international observers to observe the referendum, something that was not permitted for the [[2023 Gabonese general election]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-27 |title=Gabon: la campagne électorale pour le référendum constitutionnel débutera le 7 novembre |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20241027-gabon-la-campagne-%C3%A9lectorale-pour-le-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum-constitutionnel-d%C3%A9butera-le-7-novembre |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=RFI |language=fr}}</ref> Ballot papers used in the referendum were color-coded, with green ballots meaning "yes" and red ones meaning "no". Around 2,835 polling stations were utilised for the procedure, which ran from 07:00 to 18:00.<ref name="aj"/> A night-time curfew was declared for safety reasons.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-17 |title=Early reports say a majority of voters in Gabon cast ballots to end military rule |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/early-reports-say-a-majority-of-voters-in-gabon-cast-ballots-to-end-military-rule/7866697.html |access-date=2024-11-17 |website=VOA |language=en}}</ref>

On 17 November, Interior Minister [[Hermann Immongault]] said that the referendum had passed with over 91% support after an estimated 53% turnout but that the final results would be announced later by the [[Constitutional Court of Gabon|Constitutional Court]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-18 |title=Référendum 2024 au Gabon : La nouvelle constitution approuvée avec 91,80 % du Oui |url=https://fr.infosgabon.com/referendum-2024-au-gabon-la-nouvelle-constitution-approuvee-avec-9180-du-oui/ |access-date=2024-11-18 |website=INFOS GABON |language=fr-FR}}</ref> On 29 November, the Constitutional Court validated the results of the referendum, definitively adopting the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-29 |title=Gabon: la Cour constitutionnelle valide le "oui" au référendum|url=https://www.voaafrique.com/a/gabon-la-cour-constitutionnelle-valide-le-oui-au-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum/7881446.html |access-date=2024-11-29 |website=Voa Afrique |language=fr-FR}}</ref> On December 19, the new constitution was promulgated by the president.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-19 |title=Gabon: la nouvelle Constitution promulguée par le président de la transition|url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/en-bref/20241219-gabon-la-nouvelle-constitution-promulgu%C3%A9e-par-le-pr%C3%A9sident-de-la-transition |access-date=2024-12-19 |website=rif.fr |language=fr-FR}}</ref>
