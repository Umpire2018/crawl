In early 2024, Georgia again experienced a significant political crisis and public unrest due to the reintroduction of the "foreign agent" law, which many citizens perceived as a threat to civil liberties and democratic principles.

=== Georgian Charter ===
{{main|Georgian Charter}}

On 26 May 2024, In response to the 2023–2024 protests, President Salome Zourabichvili introduced the Georgian Charter, an action plan aimed at "fostering unity among opposition parties ahead of the parliamentary elections". The Charter, announced during [[Independence Day (Georgia)|Georgia's Independence Day]] celebrations, seeks to create a platform for the opposition to present a unified stance. Zourabichvili's proposal emphasizes a new electoral format where voters will choose between the ruling party and a coalition of opposition parties. The plan includes forming a temporary government post-elections to implement key reforms intended to "enhance democratic processes and align Georgia more closely with European standards", after which new elections will be held. The Charter's main goals include repealing laws that the opposition considers as hindrances to European integration and undertaking significant judicial and electoral reforms to ensure "a fair and democratic process".<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 May 2024 |title=Georgian Charter: President Proposes Unified Goals for Short-Term Parliament, Technical Government |url=https://civil.ge/archives/609466 |website=Civil.ge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Greisz |first=Markus |date=31 May 2024 |title=Zurabishvili's Charter: Implications for Georgia |url=https://sceeus.se/en/publications/zurabishvilis-charter-implications-for-georgia-2/ |website=[[Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies|SCEEUS]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Baccini |first=Federico |date=29 May 2024 |title=What is the pro-EU 'Georgian Charter' proposed by the President for a united front in the October elections |url=https://www.eunews.it/en/2024/05/29/what-is-the-pro-eu-georgian-charter-proposed-by-the-president-for-a-united-front-in-the-october-elections/ |website=Eunews}}</ref>

The party urged its supporters to "put everything aside and come out to vote", emphasizing the need for the ruling party to secure a constitutional majority in the election to implement its long-term goals. The party presented the objectives for which it would use the constitutional majority, which became the main campaign issues of the party.<ref name="ref" />

The Georgian Dream pledged to ban the "collective United National Movement", a term used by it to describe the former ruling United National Movement party and other parties which have signed the [[Georgian Charter]] with the UNM, envisaging a united strategy to form a coalition government to oust the Georgian Dream from power. The Georgian Dream accused the United National Movement of various "crimes against the Georgian people" during its rule, including "pushing Georgia into the war [[Russo-Georgian War|with Russia in 2008]]" and seeking to embroil Georgia into a "second front" of the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]]. According to the statement, the existence of the "collective UNM", "which is entirely controlled from outside and is constantly engaged in hostility towards the state", makes the healthy democratic process and [[Peaceful transition of power|alteration of political forces]] "impossible".<ref name="ref">{{Cite web |date=20 August 2024 |title= GD declares 2024 elections referendum on war vs. peace, traditional values vs. moral degradation |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/gd-declares-2024-elections-referendum-on-war-vs-peace-traditional-values-vs-moral-degradation/|website=1tv.ge}}</ref> Later Ivanishvili described the "Collective UNM" as a "severe disease" that has plagued the country for two decades. He asserted that the constitutional majority would enable legal action to ban "the UNM and its affiliated parties", citing legal grounds for such a move and comparing it to "[[Nuremberg Trials]]".<ref name="ivanunm">{{Cite web |date=21 August 2024 |title=Ivanishvili Hammers Home the Message of Political Revenge, Dangles Hope of Salvation |url=https://civil.ge/archives/621386 |access-date=22 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref> He further called the UNM "foreign agents who are engaged in anti-state activities". According to Ivanishvili, only when Georgia would replace the "Collective UNM" with the "patriotic political forces", it would be able to conduct "truly healthy elections".<ref name="ivanunm"/> Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze clarified that Georgian Dream intends to ban the [[Unity – National Movement]] ([[United National Movement|UNM]], [[European Georgia – Movement for Liberty]], and [[Strategy Aghmashenebeli]]), [[Coalition for Change (Georgia)|Coalition for Change]] ([[Ahali]], [[Girchi – More Freedom]], [[Droa]], and [[Republican Party of Georgia|Republican Party]]), [[Strong Georgia]] ([[Lelo for Georgia|Lelo]], [[For the People (Georgia)|For the People]], [[Freedom Square (political party)|Freedom Square]], and [[Citizens (Georgia)|Citizens]]) alliances, and the [[For Georgia]] party founded by former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia. Kobakhidze accused these parties of aligning with the United National Movement and called for criminal investigations particularly against figures like [[Mamuka Khazaradze]] of Lelo.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 August 2024 |title=Georgia goes 'North Korea' with bombshell plan to ban main opposition parties |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-opposition-ban-georgian-dream-party-election-eu-enlargement-irakli-kobakhidze/ |access-date=23 August 2024 |website=Politico |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=23 August 2024 |title=Georgian Dream names opposition parties they intend to ban |url=https://oc-media.org/georgian-dream-names-opposition-parties-they-intend-to-ban/ |access-date=23 August 2024 |website=OC Media |language=en-US}}</ref> Kobakhidze stated the prohibition of political parties is considered a democratic process when there is a legal basis for it. He argued that in a democratic state, such actions are justifiable. Kobakhidze noted that political parties have been banned in Ukraine and Moldova, and similar measures have received positive evaluations from the EU.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 August 2024 |title=პოლიტიკური პარტიების აკრძალვა დემოკრატიული პროცესია – ირაკლი კობახიძე |url=https://tvpirveli.ge/ka/siaxleebi/politika/78204-politikuri-partiebis-akrdzalva-demokratiuli-protsesia-irakli-kobakhidze?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1xdJ2pUm5QW-aNB9aOuSlI3o5KWF4Em1pO9v2ARh0P6pIuBCzkss1Yxi0_aem_RBxi2e026Dcl6inensdZ2Q |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=TV Pirveli}}</ref>

On 14 September, during the campaign event in Gori, Ivanishvili blamed the United National Movement for provoking the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and called it the "worst crime committed by them". Ivanishvili accused the UNM of committing "many atrocities" which he claimed were proved by evidences. Ivanishvili claimed that the 2008 war was "a well-planned provocation from the outside against the [[Georgians|Georgian]] and [[Ossetian people]], the purpose of which was to split unity, destroy relations and make them exist in conditions of endless, artificial confrontation". He stated that the 2008 war was "ordered from outside" and executed by the "stateless agents". He pledged to hold the "Nuremberg trials" for the UNM and also said that Georgia would need to apologize to the Ossetian people for "the flames of fire in which our Ossetian brothers and sisters were enveloped by the traitorous National Movement in 2008". He said that only Georgian Dream could ensure reconciliation with the Ossetian people.<ref>{{cite news|title= Georgia to apologize for war that Saakashvili started against Ossetians — ruling party|url=https://en.apa.az/europe/georgia-to-apologize-for-war-that-saakashvili-started-against-ossetians-ruling-party-448223|date=14 September 2024|agency=[[Azerbaijani Press Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Bidzina Ivanishvili: It took us 12 years to give a political assessment to the tragedy of 2008 – today, without any evasion, we talk about the "National Movement" that started the war, because we have a lot of evidence of the worst crime committed by them|url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133358-bidzina-ivanishvili-it-took-us-12-years-to-give-a-political-assessment-to-the-tragedy-of-2008-today-without-any-evasion-we-talk-about-the-national-movement-that-started-the-war-because-we-have-a-lot-of-evidence-of-the-worst-crime-committed-by-them/|date=14 September 2024|agency=Interpressnews}}</ref><ref name="gor">{{cite news|title= "ქართული ოცნების" საპატიო თავმჯდომარის, ბიძინა ივანიშვილის სიტყვით გამოსვლა გორში, საარჩევნო შეხვედრაზე|url=https://1tv.ge/news/qartuli-ocnebis-sapatio-tavmjdomaris-bidzina-ivanishvilis-sityvit-gamosvla-gorshi-saarchevno-shekhvedraze/|date=14 September 2024|agency=1tv.ge}}</ref> These statements of Ivansihvili proved to be particularly controversial among the public.{{refn|<ref name="nat">{{cite news|title= ივანიშვილმა და "ოცნებამ" ბოდიში უნდა მოიხადოს მოღალატეობრივი განცხადებისთვის – "ერთიანობა – ნაციონალური მოძრაობა"|url=https://formulanews.ge/News/116962|date=14 September 2024|agency=Formula TV}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133365-unity-national-movement-todays-statement-of-bidzina-ivanishvili-in-gori-is-a-national-shame-with-this-statement-georgian-dream-serves-only-the-interests-of-russia-undermines-the-policy-of-non-recognition-of-occupied-territories-and-hurts-the-national-interest-of-georgia|title="Unity – National Movement": today's statement of Bidzina Ivanishvili in Gori is a national shame – with this statement, "Georgian Dream" serves only the interests of Russia, undermines the policy of non-recognition of occupied territories and hurts the national interest of Georgia|date=25 September 2024|agency=Interpressnews}}</ref><ref name="dom">{{cite news|url=https://civil.ge/archives/624405|title= Domestic Reactions to Ivanishvili's Announced Intention to Apologize "to Ossetian Brothers and Sisters"|date=16 September 2024|agency=[[Civil Georgia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133366-mamuka-khazaradze-all-wars-in-georgia-started-with-the-hands-of-russia-sorry-we-have-to-pay-with-our-hero-boys-who-sacrificed-themselves-for-the-motherland|title=Mamuka Khazaradze: All wars in Georgia started with the hands of Russia! – Sorry, we have to pay with our hero boys who sacrificed themselves for the motherland!|date=15 September 2024|agency=Interpressnews}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://on.ge/story/132777-ბიძინა-ივანიშვილი-ივანიშვილს-ბოდიში-აქვს-მოსახდელი|title=ციტატები – სანდრო რაქვიაშვილი|date=16 September 2024|agency=On.ge}}</ref> Many relatives of Georgian soldiers who died in the 2008 war, such as the wife of [[Giorgi Antsukhelidze]], who was tortured by the South Ossetian militants, publicly denounced Ivanishvili's statements.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://on.ge/story/132736-ბიძინა-ივანიშვილის-განცხადებას-გიორგი-ანწუხელიძის-ცოლი-ქმრის-ფოტოთი-ეხმაურება|title= ბიძინა ივანიშვილის განცხადებას, გიორგი ანწუხელიძის ცოლი ქმრის ფოტოთი ეხმაურება|date=15 September 2024|agency=On.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://on.ge/story/132735-თეო-წილოსანი-ნუ-რა-გამოვიდა-ჩემი-მეუღლე-ტყუილად-შეეწირა-ქვეყნის-თავისუფლებას|title= ციტატები – თეო წილოსანი|date=15 September 2024|agency=On.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://on.ge/story/132737-თეა-ტაბატაძე-ბოდიში-შმაგი-ბოდიშ-დღევანდელი-საქართველოსთვის|title= ციტატები – თეა ტაბატაძე|date=15 September 2024|agency=On.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://on.ge/story/132734-ნიკოლოზ-გინტური-2008-წლის-ომში-დაღუპული-გმირების-მშობლებს-რა-პასუხი-უნდა-გასცენ|title= ნიკოლოზ გინტური: 2008 წლის ომში დაღუპული გმირების მშობლებს რა პასუხი უნდა გასცენ? გუშინ რომ ამბობს [ივანიშვილი], ბოდიში უნდა მოვუხადოთო, ვინ მოუხდის ბოდიშს? 2008 წელში რუსეთმა დაიწყო ომი და მათ უნდა მოგვიხადონ ბოდიში, რომ ამდენი გმირი დაგვიხოცეს.|date=15 September 2024|agency=On.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://oc-media.org/anger-in-georgia-after-ivanishvili-vows-to-apologise-to-south-ossetians-for-2008-war/|title=

The second objective presented by the Georgian Dream party envisaged a further push to adopt the [[Georgian LGBT propaganda bill|Protection of Family Values and Minors bill]], which the party had already initiated in the Georgian Parliament. The bill, intended to ban the "LGBT propaganda", has been justified by the ruling party by a necessity of preventing the spread of "pseudo-liberal ideology" into Georgia from outside.<ref name="ref"/> The bill was paired with the Georgian Dream's promise to protect the traditional values of the country. Mamuka Mdinaradze, executive secretary of the Georgian Dream, emphasized the necessity of maintaining peace, working to restore territorial integrity, and preserving traditional values and independence. He emphasized that only Georgian Dream was capable of preserving peace with Russia, and at the same time pushing for the country's European integration. Mdinaradze also emphasized the importance of traditional values and Christianity for the Georgian identity. Ultimately, he framed the party's campaign promises as "surviving physically and surviving spiritually".<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 August 2024 |title=Mamuka Mdinaradze: We must survive physically, survive spiritually and continue the dignified progress and development towards Europe with peace, dignity and prosperity while preserving the Georgian identity, national spirit and faith |url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133052-mamuka-mdinaradze-we-must-survive-physically-survive-spiritually-and-continue-the-dignified-progress-and-development-towards-europe-with-peace-dignity-and-prosperity-while-preserving-the-georgian-identity-national-spirit-and-faith|access-date=29 August 2024 |website=Interpressnews|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=21 August 2024 |title= მამუკა მდინარაძე – მთელ მსოფლიოს უნდა დავანახოთ, რომ შეუძლებელია პატრიოტი ქართველის გარედან მართვა, ბევრი რამ შეიძლება დათმოს ქართველმა კაცმა თუ ქალმა, თავისუფლებისა და დამოუკიდებლობის გარდა |url=https://1tv.ge/news/mamuka-mdinaradze-mtel-msoflios-unda-davanakhot-rom-patrioti-qartvelis-garedan-martva-sheudzlebelia-bevri-ram-sheidzleba-datmos-qartvelma-kacma-tu-qalma-tavisuflebisa-da-damoukideblobis-garda/|access-date=29 August 2024 |website=1st Channel of Georgia|language=en-US}}</ref> On 28 September, during his campaign speech in Telavi towards [[Kakhetians]], Ivanishvili further accused the UNM of trying to alienate Georgia from its national values. In particular, Ivanishvili highlighted the "UNM's attack on Georgian viniculture", which he described as a part of Georgian national identity. On the other hand, he claimed that the Georgian Dream implemented state programs to restore the viniculture, winemaking industry and [[2006 Russian ban of Moldovan and Georgian wines|traditional Russian market]].<ref name="bid">{{Cite web |date=17 September 2024 |title=Bidzina Ivanishvili on the "National Movement": these stateless people must answer for the most serious crimes – society must cut this political sarcoma from its own body |url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133614-bidzina-ivanishvili-on-the-national-movement-these-stateless-people-must-answer-for-the-most-serious-crimes-society-must-cut-this-political-sarcoma-from-its-own-body |access-date=28 September 2024 |website=Interpressnews |language=en}}</ref> Speaker of Georgian parliament [[Shalva Papuashvili]] stated that the Georgia's integration into the European Union should be paired with the respect for the Georgian traditional values, with him calling Georgia "one of the first cradles of European civilization" as "the co-creators of the fact that agriculture, viticulture, Christian faith were woven into the European identity".<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 September 2024 |title=Shalva Papuashvili: rapprochement with the European Union should not be a wordless fulfillment of instructions, but a two-way way of mutual study, mutual respect, mutual acceptance, and not merger and loss |url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133613-shalva-papuashvili-rapprochement-with-the-european-union-should-not-be-a-wordless-fulfillment-of-instructions-but-a-two-way-way-of-mutual-study-mutual-respect-mutual-acceptance-and-not-merger-and-loss |website=Interpressnews |language=en}}</ref>

The third objective outlined by the ruling party revolved around reintegrating Georgia's Russian-backed separatist regions, [[Abkhazia]] and South Ossetia. According to the Georgian Dream's statement, given the "dynamic development of events", Georgia might get a chance to "peacefully restore" its territorial integrity at "any time", therefore, "it will be necessary to amend the Constitution of Georgia to bring Georgia's governance system and territorial state structure in line with the new reality". According to the ruling party, the "externally-controlled anti-state" opposition parties would not be willing to support the restoration of territorial integrity, therefore, it would be necessary for the ruling party to hold constitutional majority.<ref name="ref"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=21 August 2024 |title=Georgia's ruling party wants to outlaw the opposition party|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-dream-party-ban-opposition-unm-mikheil-saakashvili/ |website=Politico}}</ref> There has also been a fourth issue related to "protecting Georgia's identity and national values", however, the statement said that the issue was still under discussion within the ruling party.<ref name="ref" /> Later Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the Georgian Dream, elaborated that the issue was related to "faith", with several observers speculating on a plan to make the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] a [[state religion]] in Georgia.<ref name="ref" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=25 August 2024 |title= Bidzina Ivanishvili Drops "Faith" Hint About the Planned Constitutional Change |url=https://civil.ge/archives/621542|website=[[Civil Georgia]]}}</ref> It was later confirmed that the proposed amendment would focus on designating [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity]] as the state religion. The ruling party branded this initiative as part of their commitment to uphold "national values and traditions," in line with their campaign promises to ban "[[Gay agenda|LGBT propaganda]]" and reinforce the role of the Church.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kincha |first=Shota |date=28 August 2024 |title=Georgian Dream proposes to recognise Orthodox Christianity as state religion |url=https://oc-media.org/georgian-dream-proposes-to-recognise-orthodox-christianity-as-state-religion/ |access-date=28 August 2024 |website=[[OC Media]] |language=en-US}}</ref> In contrast, the Georgian Orthodox Church has expressed skepticism, fearing that such a change could compromise its independence and increase government control. High-ranking clergy members, including Metropolitan [[Shio Mujiri]] and Metropolitan [[Nikoloz Pachuashvili]], have raised concerns about the potential implications of this proposal, arguing that it could alter the traditionally independent yet cooperative relationship between the state and the Church established by the [[Concordat of 2002|2002 Concordat]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 August 2024 |title=GOC Dissatisfied with GD's Alleged Plans to Recognize Orthodox Christianity as State Religion |url=https://civil.ge/archives/621777 |access-date=28 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref> After the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) turned down the ruling party's proposal on declaring the GOC as the state religion in Georgia, on 31 August, during the campaign rally speech in [[Ozurgeti]], Bidzina Ivanishvili once again addressed the issue.

=== Unity — National Movement ===
[[File:Unity - National Movement advertisements.jpg|thumb|Billboard and bus advertisements of the UNM-led political coalition [[Unity – National Movement]]]]
In early January 2022, it was revealed that imprisoned former president and leader of United National Movement (UNM), Mikheil Saakashvili, was working on a 9-point economic plan with the UNM economist [[Roman Gotsiridze]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 January 2024 |title=Mikheil Saakashvili to review economic plan with UNM's Roman Gotsiridze, Dekanoidze says|url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mikheil-saakashvili-to-review-economic-plan-with-unms-roman-gotsiridze-dekanoidze-says/|access-date=28 August 2024 |website=1st channel |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author=Khatia Bzhalava|date=3 February 2024 |title=Former President Mikheil Saakashvili Presents 9-point Economic Development Plan|url=http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/5082_february_4_2022/5082_khatia.html|access-date=28 August 2024 |website=The Messenger |language=en-US}}</ref>

On 10 January, Saakashvili announced that the plan was completed and soon to be presented to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|date=10 January 2022|title=Imprisoned ex-pres.

The plan outlined nine theses for economic development: judicial reform, [[English law]], [[arbitration]], decriminalization of [[economic crime]]s; de-oligarchization; energy development; elimination of bureaucracy and irrelevant spending; a single tax principle; Infrastructure and transport development; construction of the planned city of [[Lazika (planned city)|Lazika]], agricultural development and "Georgian [[Silicon Valley|silicon valley]]".<ref>{{Cite web|date=3 February 2022|title=Mikheil Saakashvili publishes the main theses of the economic vision|url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/118077-mikheil-saakashvili-publishes-the-main-theses-of-the-economic-vision/|access-date=28 August 2024 |website=Interpressnews |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=3 February 2022|title=Less bureaucracy, "stable and democratic" government change in imprisoned ex-pres.

The plan envisaged the creation of the constitutional commission on the judiciary reform, decreasing time frames for case review, and limiting corruption. It called for the unrestricted application of the English law in Georgia on the commercial matters, expansion of the application of private arbitrate, and decriminalization of economic crimes.<ref name="thes"/> The plan outlined deoligarchization as one of its main goals and proposed to ban the individuals owning more than 5% of [[Economy of Georgia (country)|Georgia's GDP]] from joining, founding or funding political parties.<ref name="thes"/>[[File: Tina Bokuchava.jpg|thumb|[[Tina Bokuchava]] presents "5 priorities" during the campaign event in [[Kvareli]].|left]]The plan envisaged Georgia's economic development model as largely infrastructure-driven. In particular, the plan focused on building new hydro power plants, railways, and airports in Georgia, for the country to become a "regional logistical and transport hub". It named the [[bitcoin]]s as a major problem, citing the "Abkhaz and Georgian clans" over-exploiting electricity, and the lack of accountability.<ref name="thes"/>

The Saakashvili plan called for [[outsourcing]] large parts of public services to the [[private sector]] and gradual [[Layoff|downsizing]] of public sector. It also revived the idea of building the new Lazika city within the planned time frame of 10 years, presenting it as a future "financial capital" of the country. For the Georgian agricultural sector, Saakashvili stated that bringing new technologies from abroad would be the only viable path for the development, and also supported the idea of cutting [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to some sectors, which he claimed would actually stimulate more entrepreneurship and growth. The plan called for "agricultural insurance system" to be devised by the government for stimulating agricultural development.<ref name="thes"/> Citing [[Belarus]], Saakashvili presented "Georgian silicon valley" as a new project. He called for [[Rustavi]] or some other city close to Tbilisi to become a "tax-free zone" and [[privatization]] of enterprises there for symbolic prices with the investment obligations.<ref name="thes" />

On 4 September 2024, the chairman of the UNM [[Tina Bokuchava]] presented "5 priorities" of her party and coalition partners during the campaign event in [[Kvareli]]: [[European integration]], increasing average income, increasing pension, strengthening Georgian families and breaking up monopolies. In foreign policy, the coalition promised opening [[Accession of Georgia to the European Union|accession negotiations]] with the European Union, negotiating [[Free trade agreements of the United States|free trade]] and [[Visa policy of the United States|visa liberalization]] agreements with the [[United States]] and scrapping [[Foreign funding of NGOs#Georgia|Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence]]. In terms of internal policy, Bokuchava promised free [[school meals]], free [[housing]] for students and cancelling pension loans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/133197-unity-national-movement-presented-5-election-priorities/|title="Unity – National Movement" presented 5 election priorities|publisher= Interpressnews |date=4 September 2024 }}</ref>

The Unity – National Movement prioritizes securing Georgia's membership in the European Union. Together with its coalition partners, the party plans to initiate EU accession talks immediately after winning the election, unlocking access to Georgia's "14 billion [[euro]] European fund". Additionally, the party commits to signing a [[free trade agreement]] with the United States and securing [[visa-free travel]] for Georgian citizens to the U.S. The party also promises to create tens of thousands of new jobs annually. A 1 billion euro EU subsidy will be allocated to agriculture, with the goal of increasing the average national salary to 3,500 lari and setting a minimum wage of 1,500 lari. Other key pledges include abolishing pension loans, raising pensions to 1,000 lari, and establishing a billion-lari fund in Mikheil Saakashvili's name to support the return of [[Georgian diaspora|Georgian emigrants]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=ერთიანობა – ნაციონალური მოძრაობა |url=https://www.occrp.org/interactives/polit-watch/ka/parties/4/ertianoba-natsionaluri-modzraoba |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=პოლიტმრიცხველი |language=ka}}</ref>

=== For Georgia ===
On 8 August 2024, the For Georgia party leader, Giorgi Gakharia, went to [[Batumi]] to meet with the people and canvass the vote. On 17 August 2024, Gakharia officially kicked off the party's election campaign with the opening ceremony in [[Zugdidi]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 August 2024 |title= Campaign Beat: August 6–19 |url=https://civil.ge/archives/619220|access-date=28 August 2024 |website=Civil Georgia |language=en-US}}</ref> Gakharia's promises during the election campaign included increasing the [[minimum wage]] from 50 [[Georgian lari|GEL]] to 950 GEL, introducing six-month [[unemployment benefit]]s and tying the increase of pensions with that of the economy.<ref name="khel">{{cite web |title="მინიმალური ხელფასი ამ ქვეყანაში მინიმუმ, დღეს, უნდა იყოს 950 ლარი" – გიორგი გახარია|url=https://paraleli.ge/76683/მინიმალური-ხელფასი-ამ-ქვ/ |date=9 August 2024 |website=paraleli.ge}}</ref> For Georgia believes healthcare is a fundamental human right, and the state must ensure its protection. The party plans to transition to a compulsory universal healthcare insurance model, funded by excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and vehicle imports. Primary healthcare will be strengthened, doctors retrained, and service quality and regulated costs to ensure access to quality medicines. The party is committed to fast-tracking Georgia's EU integration, ensuring sectoral benefits like access to the single market, the [[Energy policy of the European Union|European Energy Union]], and application of digital policies before full membership. Additionally, the party advocates for NATO membership without a [[Membership Action Plan (MAP)|"Membership Action Plan" (MAP)]], following [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]'s model. Economically, the party aims to establish a European-style [[Welfare state|social state]], focused on sustainable and inclusive growth. Key priorities include employment programs, sectoral policy development, and an export financing agency. A 4-year infrastructure project will complete [[gasification]], [[water supply]], and [[internet access]] nationwide, with an emphasis on building a green economy to safeguard natural resources. In education, the party seeks to promote critical thinking, civic awareness, and lifelong learning through improved quality, infrastructure, and financing. Defense spending will rise to 2% of GDP, and military cooperation with Western partners, especially the United States, will enhance Georgia's defense capabilities. The depoliticization and strengthening of the State Security Service will focus on combating hybrid threats from Russia.

The party will draft a national strategy for de-occupation and peaceful reunification of the country, involving public and Western partner input within one year. Governance reforms will strengthen institutions, ensure mutual checks and balances, and promote fair, [[Free and fair election|transparent elections]]. Key government appointments (e.g., prosecutor general, court judges) will be made through political consensus. [[Judicial reform]]s will focus on eliminating corruption, including the removal of high-ranking officials who have lost public trust. The [[High Council of Justice (Georgia)|High Council of Justice]] will undergo comprehensive reform to restore integrity. Fighting corruption is a central priority. The party promises to dismantle elite networks that enrich themselves at the expense of citizens, ensuring regional and municipal governments are free from corruption. Through fiscal decentralization, municipalities will gain more authority and resources, with anti-corruption units established locally to monitor risks.<ref>{{Cite web |title=გახარია საქართველოსთვის |url=https://www.occrp.org/interactives/polit-watch/ka/parties/7/gakharia-saqartvelostvis |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=პოლიტმრიცხველი |language=ka}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ღირსეული ცხოვრების მანიფესტი |url=https://forgeo.ge/upload/manifests/1/384bcd2ac87bb29915ef53f71c10e1d0.pdf |website=გახარია საქართველოსთვის |language=ka}}</ref>

=== Strong Georgia===
On 5 September 2024, the Strong Georgia coalition presented its election plan called "Ilia's way"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ilia's Way |url=https://dzlieri9.ge/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/didi-ilias-gza-akhaliii-v2.0.pdf}}</ref> to the public in [[Saguramo]], in the vicinity of [[Ilia Chavchavadze]]'s statue. The coalition stated that it would introduce a [[visa regime]] for Russian citizens in Georgia, restrict direct flights with Russia, and ban selling agricultural land to Russians. It promised to push for [[Anaklia#Anaklia Port Project|Anaklia deepwater port]] construction and to create "200 thousand new jobs", although it did not specify what measures would be taken for this goal. It promised to introduce a heavy [[gambling]] tax and use the increased budget funds to raise pensions. [[Ana Dolidze]], [[Social democracy|social democratic]] member of coalition from For the People party, presented plan to increase average income and minimum wage. She announced that these goals would be achieved in cooperation with the "business, small and medium businesses". Levan Tsutskiridze, a leader of [[Freedom Square (political party)|Freedom Square party]], focused on education reform. The coalition promised greater [[European Integration]], vowing to establish special ministry to push for Georgia's accession to the EU, increase trade with the EU, and create greater opportunities for the youth to move to the European countries through [[student exchange program]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiotavisupleba.ge/a/33108590.html|title= "ილიას გზა" – "ძლიერმა საქართველომ" საარჩევნო გეგმა წარადგინა |publisher= Radio Liberty |date=5 September 2024|language=ka}}</ref>

On 19 September, during the meeting with pensioners, Mamuka Khazaradze noted that the coalition was planning to increase the taxes on gambling from 15% to 25%, citing [[Illinois]] as an example. He also called for an end to the "exploitative practices related to pension loans and overdrafts" and promised "proper oversight" over the [[pension fund]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/strong-georgia-proposes-25-tax-on-gaming-industry-to-raise-pensions-to-1000-gel/|title= Strong Georgia proposes 25% tax on gaming industry to raise pensions to 1,000 GEL |publisher= 1st Channel of Georgia |date=19 September 2024|language=ka}}</ref> A key component of Lelo's platform is its 1,000 GEL pension plan for seniors, which Khazaradze assured is a concrete initiative rather than a campaign slogan. "This is about ensuring that our pensioners have the basic means to live in dignity," he explained.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Messenger – Opposition Union 'Strong Georgia' Unveils Election Program 'Ilia's Path' |url=https://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/5730_september_6_2024/5730_liza.html |access-date=17 October 2024 |website=www.messenger.com.ge}}</ref>

The coalition plans to draft regulations aimed at separating educational institutions from political control, promoting independence within the [[Educational system|education system]]. Proposed initiatives include developing a [[School meal|school nutrition]] program, providing housing support for students, updating research laboratories, promoting [[vocational education]], and increasing the number of kindergartens in municipalities with significant ethnic minority populations. Additionally, the coalition intends to establish a national security system based on NATO best practices, which will involve reforms to the [[National Security Council (Georgia)|National Security Council]]. Plans include reinstating visa regulations for Russian citizens and limiting the influence of Russian soft power in Georgia. To address the needs of populations in occupied regions and promote peaceful conflict resolution, the coalition aims to create better educational and employment opportunities while enhancing access to prospects arising from Georgia's candidacy for European Union membership and establishing [[Free economic zone|free economic and trade zones]].

The coalition supports democratic governance, allowing all parties to operate freely while strengthening local [[Self-governance|self-government]] and decentralizing power. They plan a comprehensive review of judges through a [[vetting]] mechanism, leading to the dissolution of the current judicial council. A new council will be formed based on the vetting results, increasing the number of judges and welcoming qualified professionals from outside the existing system. A National Anti-Corruption Agency is proposed, equipped with investigative powers and accountable to parliament. Reforms will focus on improving the state procurement system, increasing transparency regarding offshore companies, and subjecting any undocumented property obtained through corruption to confiscation. The coalition argues that existing Controversial laws hinder Georgia's European integration and do not align with national interests, and they plan to repeal these laws upon taking office.

The coalition envisions a decentralization process that provides municipalities and councils with increased financial resources and authority tailored to local needs. To achieve this, they intend to strengthen the role of councils, abolish state representative administrations, and improve the management of local revenues for greater financial independence. They will also review current administrative-territorial arrangements and the status of self-governing cities altered in 2017, while reinforcing the functions of the parliamentary committee on regional policy and self-government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ძლიერი საქართველო – ლელო, ხალხისთვის, თავისუფლებისთვის! |url=https://www.occrp.org/interactives/polit-watch/ka/parties/3/dzlieri-saqartvelo-lelo-khalkhistvis-tavisuphlebistvis |access-date=23 October 2024 |website=პოლიტმრიცხველი |language=ka}}</ref>

===Coalition for Change===
On 25 September 2024, Nika Gvaramia, co-leader of the Coalition for Change, announced he would not be on the coalition's candidate list, pledging to make space for new people. The following day, it was revealed that the top spot on the CfC's electoral list would be held by Nana Malashkhia, known as the "Woman with the EU Flag", a symbol of the March protests.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 September 2024 |title=Gvaramia Not to Run for MP |url=https://civil.ge/archives/625897 |access-date=1 October 2024 |website=Civil Georgia |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/georgia-woman-protests-eu-flag-/32317343.html |title=The Georgian Woman With The EU Flag |date=14 March 2023 |language=en |access-date=1 October 2024 |via=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vincent |first=Faustine |date=18 March 2023 |title=Georgia protester holding European flag hailed as heroine |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/03/18/georgia-protester-holding-european-flag-hailed-as-heroine_6019830_4.html |access-date=1 October 2024 |work=[[Le Monde]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 October 2024 |title=მომავალი შენია! {{!}} "კოალიცია ცვლილებისთვის" პირველი ყრილობა |url=https://mtavari.tv/news/166230-momavali-shenia-koalitsia-tsvlilebistvis-pirveli |access-date=5 October 2024 |website=[[Mtavari Arkhi]] |language=ka}}</ref>

During the congress in Rustavi, Gvaramia addressed the audience. Gvaramia told the representatives of small and medium businesses that they represented "the driving force propelling this country forward" and promised them to lower taxes, attract more investments and open avenues to the European, American, and Chinese markets. In addition, Gvaramia addressed Georgian farmers, saying "do not let anyone deceive you into believing that you need state assistance every year. Do not be misled into thinking that your labor is futile or that Russia is your only solution. The European Union, the United States, and China offer enormous markets, which will be available to you once we take office".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/for-change-coalition-leader-promises-support-for-business-growth-and-investment/|title= For Change Coalition leader promises support for business growth and investment |publisher=1st Channel of Georgia  |date=1 October 2024|language=en}}</ref> Gvaramia emphasized his own experience of what he called a "[[Political prisoner|political imprisonment]]" at the hands of the Georgian Dream government, addressing the prison population by telling them that "I will be your supporter in every circumstance" and promising to deliver them what they deserve.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/nika-gvaramia-apologizes-to-prisoners/|title= Nika Gvaramia apologizes to prisoners |publisher=1st Channel of Georgia |date=1 October 2024|language=en}}</ref> 
[[File:Ahali_electoral_billboard_2024.jpg|thumb|Coalition for Change electoral billboard "The future is yours"]]On 17 October, Nika Gvaramia, presented the main directions of the coalition's program to the public. Gvaramia introduced the "4-4-4 Plan", which outlines initiatives in four key areas to be implemented within four days of the formation of the new parliament. According to Gvaramia, the coalition aims to prioritize the following four areas immediately after taking office:

* European Integration – Within four days, the coalition promises to initiate negotiations with the [[EU]] for Georgia's membership, citing the [[Georgian Charter]], the historical choice of the country, and the will of the Georgian people. Gvaramia highlighted that Georgian politicians, along with civil society, have worked extensively on Georgia's European integration.
* Democracy – Gvaramia affirmed the coalition's commitment to the Georgian Charter, specifically regarding the creation of a technical or [[Provisional government|transitional government]], which the coalition will support. He also emphasized the importance of abolishing "Russian laws" introduced in recent years, beyond just the ones that have triggered public protests. This effort, he explained, is critical for Georgia's path towards European integration and includes broader reforms, such as court reforms and vetting processes.
* Economy – The coalition plans to propose tax reforms within four days, which include reducing income tax to 15%, exempting small businesses (with a turnover under 400,000 GEL) from [[Value-added tax|VAT]], and lowering corporate tax to 5%. Gvaramia noted that these changes would benefit around 75% of businesses in Georgia, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
* Education – By 2028, the coalition aims to significantly increase the education budget to adequately support all levels of education. Gvaramia outlined the creation of a "Knowledge Piggy Bank," providing 5,000 GEL in annual educational funding for every child, from kindergarten to higher education. He also mentioned the need for universities to address student housing through their own revenues, with additional state support for scientific research to reach one billion [[Georgian lari|lari]] by 2028.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 October 2024 |title=გვარამიამ "კოალიცია ცვლილებისთვის" პროგრამის მთავარი მიმართულებები წარადგინა |url=https://publika.ge/gvaramiam-koalicia-cvlilebistvis-programis-mtavari-mimartulebebi-waradgina/ |access-date=17 October 2024 |website=Publika |language=ka-GE}}</ref>

=== Alliance of Patriots of Georgia ===
During the election campaign, the Alliance of Patriots, [[Conservative Movement/Alt-Info]] and Georgian Idea, running on the same electoral list, held joint meetings with the supporters throughout country. The meetings were held in Mtskheta, Rustavi, [[Dedoplistskaro]], Gori, [[Zestaponi]], Batumi, [[Kutaisi]] and others. Moreover, members of Alt-Info opened several new offices in various regions to better communicate with the potential voters.<ref name="meet"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://alt-info.ge/archives/22926|title=წინასაარჩევნო კამპანიის ფარგლებში, დიდი ეროვნული ერთობის რეგიონული ოფისები აქტიურად იხსნება|publisher=[[Alt-Info]]|date=10 September 2024|language=ka}}</ref>

During the meetings, the parties presented several initiatives to the voters. In terms of education, the parties promised to introduce teaching [[religion]] into school curriculums, increase wages for teachers, [[free school meals]] and extra-courses, and free [[strength training]] sections in all schools. In healthcare and social protection, the parties promised [[universal health care]], establishing state-run pharmacies run on low prices to counteract privately held pharmacies and monopolies, and [[Abortion law|an abortion ban]]. To reinvigorate economy, the parties stated that they would issue low-percent state loans to the businesses, protect Georgian businesses from foreign imports through high [[tariff]]s, negotiate opening up Russian and other post-Soviet markets for Georgian products, and [[Nationalization|nationalize]] "strategic resources". The parties said that they would argue for a ban on foreign ownership of Georgian agricultural land, an increased support for local [[manufacturing]], as well as abolishing taxes on land in mountainous regions to counteract their [[Population decline|depopulation]]. The parties named several legislative proposals they would push for in the Parliament of Georgia: expanding the use of [[referendum]]s to decide on public issues, making the office of [[Public Defender of Georgia]] electable, abolishing "[[Anti-gender movement|gender legislation]]", introducing an [[amnesty]] for those imprisoned on [[family violence]] charges, and establishing a "real anti-monopoly agency".<ref name="meet">{{cite web |url=https://alt-info.ge/archives/22654|title=დიდი ეროვნული ერთობის წინასაარჩევნო კამპანია – "ალტ-ინფოს", "საქართველოს პატრიოტთა ალიანსისა" და "ქართული იდეის" ლიდერები თანამოაზრეებს ქვეყნის მასშტაბით ხვდებიან – ფოტოკოლაჟი|publisher=[[Alt-Info]]|date=9 September 2024|language=ka}}</ref>

In September 2024, the Alliance of Patriots published its electoral video clip called "Why are we poor?". It argued that Georgia remains a developing economy because for 30 years (since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]) the country "had been run on [[free market]] economic principles", such as the idea that if state does not intervene in the economy, the market will "self-regulate" with "[[invisible hand]]". Criticizing this theory, the video clip cited China and South Korea as examples of the "most successful development models", with them being "[[mixed economy|hybrid economies]]" in which the state runs and intervenes in the "strategic sectors", while otherwise allowing free entrepreneurship. The video clip credited this model for creating and developing "high-tech industries" in these countries, such as [[automotive industry]], [[electronics industry]] etc. The video clip also argued for increased [[protectionism]] against cheap foreign imports to boost local economy and negotiating with Russia to open up its market for Georgian products, which it argued would be crucial for the economic development.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t43Dimhqxr4|title=👉 რატომ ვართ ღარიბები? – ქართული ალტერნატივა|publisher=ქართული ალტერნატივა|date=10 September 2024|language=ka}}</ref>

=== New Political Centre — Girchi ===
Girchi advocates for a range of economic policies intended to redistribute wealth, stimulate growth, and reduce poverty. One key proposal is the distribution of state-owned property to citizens. Currently, approximately 90% of Georgia's land and natural resources are owned by the state, including forests, rivers, universities, and other assets. Girchi proposes to distribute this property equally among citizens, allowing for greater individual wealth and ownership. Another major policy is the introduction of a [[Universal basic income|Universal Basic Income]] of 500 lari per month for every citizen. Girchi argues that UBI would eliminate extreme poverty by replacing a variety of social welfare programs with a fixed monthly payment to all citizens. The system is designed to be simple, with fewer bureaucratic processes and reduced administrative costs.

Girchi also supports a multi-currency system, allowing the use of foreign currencies such as the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and the euro alongside the Georgian lari. This policy aims to protect citizens from inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, giving people the choice of which currency to use for transactions. The party proposes the return of pension funds to citizens and the abolition of the current pension system, which it views as exploitative. Instead of mandatory pension contributions, Girchi suggests returning available pension funds to contributors. Girchi is also committed to reducing taxes that disproportionately affect the poor, including excise, property, and import taxes. The party aims to balance [[tax cut]]s without creating a budget deficit and proposes eliminating taxes on personal imports from abroad, such as the current 300 lari customs limit.

Another economic policy involves the redistribution of [[National Bank of Georgia|National Bank]] reserves to citizens. Girchi believes the National Bank's foreign currency reserves, accumulated through currency market interventions, should be equally distributed among the population, providing approximately $1,200 to each citizen. Girchi further advocates for full land ownership rights, extending property ownership from the current two-meter depth to a greater extent. This would give individuals full control over their land, including mineral and resource rights. The party proposes reforms in the automobile sector, advocating for less government interference in vehicle imports and usage. Under this policy, citizens would not be penalized for issues like tinted windows or lack of technical inspections as long as safety regulations are respected.

Girchi emphasizes reducing the role of government in everyday life. The party advocates for the dismantling of bureaucratic structures that, in its view, perpetuate poverty. Girchi proposes offering public sector employees who voluntarily leave their positions continued salary payments for three years, encouraging a transition to the private sector. Girchi calls for a great amnesty as a solution to Georgia's flawed judicial system, which still operates under outdated Soviet-era laws. The amnesty would reduce sentences for prisoners, with life sentences being commuted to 30 years, and administrative fines being written off entirely.
[[File:Girchi in parliament.png|thumb|260x260px|The Girchi MPs in parliament: [[Iago Khvichia]], [[Vakhtang Megrelishvili]], [[Alexandre Rakviashvili|Sandro Rakviashvili]], and [[Herman Szabó|Herman Szabo]].]]
The party also advocates for elective judges and the expansion of the jury system. Under this system, judges of the first instance would be directly elected by the people, rather than appointed by politicians, in order to ensure judicial independence. Defendants would also have the right to choose trial by jury for criminal cases with potential prison sentences of six months or more. Girchi supports a reform of the Criminal Code, arguing that actions without a victim or complainant should not be considered crimes. The party seeks to humanize Georgia's criminal justice system by removing outdated or overly punitive laws.

Additionally, Girchi proposes the electability of local police chiefs, decentralizing control over law enforcement to local communities. This would enable municipalities to elect their own police leaders, who would be accountable to the local population rather than the central government. Girchi also envisions a Central Investigation Service, similar to the FBI in the United States, that would handle organized and serious crimes beyond the scope of local police forces. The party calls for the [[Drug liberalization|liberalization of drug policy]], advocating for the decriminalization of all drugs and the regulation of [[Cannabis in Georgia (country)|cannabis]] and other drugs classified by the [[World Health Organization]] as less harmful than tobacco and alcohol.

Girchi supports the abolition of the common national curriculum, allowing schools to determine their own teaching methods and content. The party also advocates for legalizing home-schooling and removing state regulations from universities, including the elimination of national entrance exams. Girchi proposes transitioning to a professional volunteer army with higher pay and modern equipment, as opposed to the current system of mandatory conscription. The party supports increasing the defense budget to meet NATO standards and advocates for building strong partnerships with Western allies to improve military training and capability.

Girchi prioritizes NATO membership and deeper integration with the European Union to ensure Georgia's security and sovereignty. The party also advocates for free trade agreements with all countries and seeks to promote traditional human rights on the international stage. Girchi emphasizes decentralization as a key component of its platform. The party seeks to give greater autonomy to local governments by allowing municipalities to elect their own judges and police chiefs, and by permitting regions to set their own tax rates.

Girchi also supports lowering the parliamentary [[Electoral threshold|election threshold]] to a natural barrier of 0.67%, arguing that this would encourage the representation of smaller parties in parliament and foster political diversity. The party opposes the current system of public funding for political parties, advocating instead for parties to be funded by their supporters. Girchi views the return of [[Abkhazia (region)|Abkhazia]] as one of Georgia's most challenging tasks. The party believes this will only be achievable with strong international alliances, particularly with the United States and the European Union. Girchi advocates for a strong military to bolster peaceful negotiations and ensure that Georgia is respected on the international stage. The party also seeks to create an economic and political environment in Georgia that would encourage Abkhazian citizens to reintegrate with Georgia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=გირჩის პროგრამა |url=https://girchi.com/articles/girchis-programa |access-date=23 October 2024 |website=გირჩი |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=გირჩი |url=https://www.occrp.org/interactives/polit-watch/ka/parties/6/girchi |access-date=23 October 2024 |website=პოლიტმრიცხველი |language=ka}}</ref>

=== Labour Party ===
The Labor Party of Georgia emphasizes the importance of establishing fully free healthcare, including [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Therapy|treatment]], [[surgery]], and rehabilitation, while advocating for [[state hospital]]s to be treated equally to private facilities. They argue that national wealth—encompassing resources such as [[gold]], [[manganese]], [[iron]], energy, and the ports of [[Batumi Seaport|Batumi]] and [[Poti Sea Port|Poti]]—should be returned to state control through nationalization, with profits distributed among households to bolster the national budget for education, school meals, and pensions.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

In terms of energy, the party supports nationalization, asserting that a state monopoly on electricity generation and distribution will lead to lower costs for consumers. They propose banning the construction of dams, advocating instead for a shift toward solar energy. The Labor Party proposes establishing a minimum hourly wage of 10 lari, introducing [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment compensation]], and penalizing companies for exploitative labor practices. They also plan to raise pensions to European standards, Additionally, the party promises a one-time assistance payment of 10,000 lari for every newborn, aiming to encourage population growth. To support local [[agriculture]], the Labor Party intends to restrict agricultural imports through high customs tariffs, making domestic production more profitable and subsidizing the harvests of various crops. They also pledge to limit access to [[online casino]]s and betting to mitigate social issues associated with gambling.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

In education, the Labor Party commits to providing free schooling at all levels, offering two meals a day for students, and ensuring personal computers and internet access for children from first to twelfth grades. They aim to facilitate job placements for students and offer scholarships for higher education abroad, contingent upon their return to Georgia. The party also plans to align teachers' salaries with judges' salaries, emphasizing the role of education in reducing crime and fostering social harmony. The Labor Party seeks to transition from [[Conscription|mandatory military service]] to a contract-based system, viewing compulsory service as a potential source of corruption. They aim to dismantle oligarchic influence in politics, advocating for a European-style socialism with a [[Nordic model]] to prevent wealthy individuals from leveraging their resources for political gain. The party also criticizes the Georgian Dream for adopting controversial laws, viewing this as a betrayal that threatens the country's European aspirations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=საქართველოს ლეიბორისტული პარტია |url=https://www.occrp.org/interactives/polit-watch/ka/parties/8/saqartvelos-leiboristuli-partia |access-date=23 October 2024 |website=პოლიტმრიცხველი |language=ka}}</ref>

==Conduct==
According to the observer mission from the [[International Republican Institute]], "Georgia’s parliamentary elections were fundamentally flawed due to a legal framework and regulatory practices that hindered genuine electoral competition, misuse of public resources by the ruling government, the targeting of civil society, obstruction of opposition parties, systematic voter intimidation...only new elections can restore the Georgian people’s confidence in their government’s legitimacy."<ref name="iri.org"/>

On election day, a polling station was closed in [[Marneuli]] after footage emerged of [[ballot stuffing]] being conducted there, during which an election observer was attacked while trying to film the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Polling station closed in southern Georgia during election following reported ballot stuffing |url=https://kyivindependent.com/polling-station-closed-in-southern-georgia-during-election-following-reported-ballot-stuffing/ |access-date=26 October 2024 |website=The Kyiv Independent |date=26 October 2024 |language=en}}</ref> The CEC said that a criminal investigation had been opened and all results originating from the precinct would be declared invalid.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Georgia votes in an election that could take it toward the EU or into Russia's orbit |url=https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-european-union-russia-06103525947fe3a1d372539a74cb573f |access-date=26 October 2024 |website=Associated Press |date=26 October 2024 |language=en}}</ref> Two people were hospitalized after Georgian Dream supporters attacked the offices of the UNM.

On 20 December 2024, the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|OSCE]]'s [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR) published its analysis of the election. The ODIHR found that the election was managed efficiently in a technical sense, but was publicly perceived as biased as a result of legal changes in the details of the electoral management process, with concerns about the role of people linked to the ruling party. The use of electronic devices for voting was found to lack transparency in access and documentation. Official election campaigning began a month before candidate registration closed, contrary to ODIHR recommendations; this led to disputes about media airtime allocation and financial reporting.<ref name="ODIHR_Georgian26Oct2024_observation_mission_final">{{cite Q|Q131531638|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ODIHR found that there were "few" [[women in government|women candidates]] and insufficient "specific messaging for women" in party programmes. Women were mostly in the majority in low-level electoral commissions, but a minority (four out of 17) in the Central Election Commission (CEC).<ref name="ODIHR_Georgian26Oct2024_observation_mission_final" />

According to the ODIHR report, the campaign period included "intimidation, coercion, inducement and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees and the economically vulnerable". Campaign financing, both state and private, advantaged the ruling party and controls were applied inconsistently. Media coverage and media regulation advantaged the ruling party and disadvantaged the opposition. Two hundred complaints in relation to the electoral process were filed prior to the election. The procedures of the CEC and Precinct Election Commissions (PECs) in handling the complaints were mostly made by non-collegial, non-transparent processes, often without "adequate investigation of the merits" of the complaints.<ref name="ODIHR_Georgian26Oct2024_observation_mission_final" />

During the election, several citizens' groups' electoral observers reported intimidation and obstacles. There was "widespread intimidation of voters". Most of the 1200 complaints filed following the election were dismissed by the District Election Commissions (DECs), the CEC, courts and the [[Constitutional Court of Georgia|Constitutional Court]].<ref name="ODIHR_Georgian26Oct2024_observation_mission_final" />

==Electoral system==

The Parliament of Georgia is composed of 150 members who are elected for a four-year term. As stipulated by constitutional amendments that were adopted on 26 September 2017, the 2024 election will mark the move to a fully [[Proportional representation|proportional system]]. The 150 members of parliament are elected by [[closed list]] on a single national constituency, with a 5% electoral threshold to be awarded seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=MPs Pass Constitutional Changes with First Reading |url=https://old.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=30216 |website=Civil.ge |date=23 June 2017 | access-date=5 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Parliament Approves Constitution on Final Reading|url=http://old.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=30472|access-date=27 September 2017|work=Civil Georgia|date=27 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="const">{{cite news|title=Key Points of Newly Adopted Constitution|url=http://old.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=30474|access-date=27 September 2017|work=Civil Georgia|date=27 September 2017}}</ref> To determine the number of seats obtained by a political party, the number of votes it has obtained is multiplied by 150 and divided by the sum of votes received by all those that received at least 5% of the valid votes cast in the elections. If the seats obtained by the political parties is less than 150, the remaining seats are successively awarded to the political parties having better results.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Code of Georgia, article 125|date=9 February 2023|url=https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/1557168?publication=85|website=Matsne|access-date=20 February 2023|language=en}}</ref> On 6 February 2023, the Central Election Commission of Georgia (CEC) adopted a decree introducing an electronic voter registration and voting system at most of the polling stations.<ref>{{cite news|title=90% of Voters Will Vote Electronically in 2024 Parliamentary Elections|url=https://civil.ge/archives/524496|access-date=10 February 2023|work=Civil Georgia|date=6 February 2023}}</ref>

On 4 April 2024, Georgia's Parliament swiftly abolished mandatory [[gender quota]]s, with 85 MPs voting in favor and 22 against. Previously, the law required that at least one in every four candidates on a party list be a woman. The decision was part of a deal between the ruling [[Georgian Dream]] party and the opposition [[Girchi – More Freedom|Girchi]] party: Georgian Dream supported Girchi's proposal to abolish the quotas, while Girchi agreed to back the Georgian Dream candidate for CEC Chairperson.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 April 2024 |title=Parliament Abolishes Quotas for Women MPs |url=https://civil.ge/archives/590165 |access-date=3 September 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 July 2024 |title=Ombudsman's Office: ODIHR/OSCE has negatively assessed the abolition of gender quotas in Georgia |url=https://jam-news.net/abolition-of-gender-quotas-in-georgia/ |access-date=3 September 2024 |website=JAMnews |language=en-US}}</ref> On 27 August 2024, president Salome Zourabichvili signed a decree setting 26 October as the date for the parliamentary elections.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 August 2024 |title=President Salome Zurabishvili Sets Parliamentary Election Day for October 26, Speaks About its "Existential" Importance |url=https://civil.ge/archives/621729|website=[[Civil Georgia]]}}</ref>

On 20 February 2024, the Georgian Parliament passed amendments to the electoral code with 81 votes in the third reading. These amendments change how the chairman and "professional members" of the CEC are elected and abolish the deputy chairman role, traditionally reserved for an opposition representative. Under the new law, the Speaker of Parliament, instead of the president, nominates and opens the competition for the election of the CEC Chairman and professional members. Parliament requires a 3/5 majority (90 votes) in the first round to elect candidates. If unsuccessful, a simple majority (76 votes) can be used in the next round, with two attempts allowed. If both attempts fail, the president gains the authority to appoint the CEC chairperson/member. The law also stipulates that CEC members serve a full five-year term, even if elected with a lower quorum. The CEC is composed of 17 members: 7 nominated by the Speaker of Parliament and appointed by Parliament, and 9 nominated by opposition parties. The opposition and civil society organizations argue that these changes increase political pressure on the CEC and compromise its neutrality, violating the [[European Commission]]'s conditions<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 November 2023 |title=EC Spells Out Nine Steps for Georgia to Start Accession Negotiations |url=https://civil.ge/archives/568417 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref> and ignoring the [[Venice Commission]]'s recommendations against these amendments.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 February 2024 |title=Parliament Passes Amendments to CEC Staffing Rules |url=https://civil.ge/archives/583340 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

On 30 May, the Parliament adopted further amendments to the electoral code, including changes to the CEC's operational rules and the abolition of the CEC advisory group, which included representatives from the Public Defender and selected national and international experts. The ruling Georgian Dream party justified these changes by claiming that the advisory group was not functional due to the lack of participation from monitoring organizations. Another significant amendment is the change in the CEC's decision-making process. Previously, decisions required a two-thirds majority. Now, if a decision cannot be passed in a CEC meeting, it will be subject to a revote at the same meeting and will be considered passed if it receives a majority vote. The ruling party defends this as an anti-deadlock mechanism.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 May 2024 |title=Parliament Adopts Amendments to Election Code |url=https://civil.ge/archives/610396 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref> On 16 August, the CEC issued a decree requiring the chairman of each precinct election commission to draw lots to assign duties among commission members one week before the election, instead of on election day. Critics argue this change gives authorities time to influence the election process and threatens transparency. The opposition has challenged this decree in court, but the Tbilisi City Court upheld the CEC's decision. Independent watchdogs and opposition parties remain concerned that these changes undermine the election process's fairness and transparency, particularly ahead of the critical elections in October.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 August 2024 |title=CEC's New Rule for Precinct Commissions Fuels Fears of Election Influencing |url=https://civil.ge/archives/621172 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

Concerns have been raised about the voting rights of Georgian emigrants. Despite the significant economic impact of Georgian emigrants through remittances, their participation in national elections remains limited. Official statistics indicate that over 125,000 people left Georgia in the past year, while estimates suggest that the number of Georgian emigrants could be as high as 1.6 million. The current voting procedures for Georgians abroad are criticized for being cumbersome, with few polling stations often located only in major cities, making it challenging for emigrants residing in more remote areas to vote. As a result, voter turnout among emigrants has been relatively low; for instance, only 66,217 registered to vote in the [[2020 Georgian parliamentary election|2020 parliamentary elections]], with just 12,247 actually participating. Various stakeholders, including opposition parties, non-governmental organizations, and president Salome Zourabichvili, advocate for more accessible voting options, such as additional polling stations, electronic voting, or extended voting periods. However, the government, led by the ruling Georgian Dream party, has been slow to respond, citing bureaucratic and logistical challenges. Critics argue that the reluctance to reform the voting process may stem from a political strategy to limit the influence of emigrants, who are perceived as a potentially opposition-leaning electorate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tsaava |first=Maradia |date=3 April 2024 |title="Crossing half the continent to cast a vote": Georgians abroad want to participate in Georgia elections |url=https://jam-news.net/immigrant-participation-in-georgias-elections/ |website=JAMnews}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 March 2024 |title=EECMD Urges Speedy Discussion of Draft Law to Streamline Emigrants' Voting |url=https://civil.ge/archives/585209 |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Apriamashvili |first=Sopho |date=31 July 2024 |title=Lost votes: What prevents Georgian emigrants from participating in parliamentary elections |url=https://jam-news.net/parliamentary-elections-in-georgia/ |access-date=21 August 2024 |website=JAMnews |language=en-US}}</ref> In September 2024, the CEC said that it would open 60 polling stations in 42 countries.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 October 2024 |title=Pivotal moment for Georgians with future in Europe at stake |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9wve5k19o |access-date=16 October 2024 |website=[[BBC]] |language=en-UK}}</ref>

==Opinion polls==
Prior to the election, polls were being conducted by a number of pollsters in Georgia. The Edison Research polls were commissioned by the pro-opposition [[Formula TV]], while another pro-opposition channel Mtavari Arkhi commissioned ISSA and [[Savanta]] to conduct the polls.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 July 2024|title=ოპოზიციური კოალიცია თუ რამდენიმე გაერთიანება – ამომრჩევლის აზრი Edison Research-ის კვლევით|url=https://formulanews.ge/News/114844|access-date=31 August 2024 |website=Formulanews|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=13 April 2024|title=ISSA-ის სოციოლოგიური კვლევის შედეგები სრული ვერსია|url=https://mtavari.tv/news/153386-issa-sotsiologiuri-kvlevis-shedegebi-sruli-versia|access-date=13 April 2024 |website=Mtavari TV|language=en-US}}</ref> The polls by Georgian Opinion Research Business International (GORBI) were conducted on behalf of pro-government Imedi TV company.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nikoladze |first=Tatia |date=14 June 2022 |title=Poll: Pro-government media amplify anti-Western narrative in Georgia |url=https://jam-news.net/poll-pro-government-media-amplify-anti-western-narrative-in-georgia/ |access-date=3 September 2024 |website=JAMnews |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=GORBI: If elections were held this week, 59.3% of respondents would vote for GD, UNM / Strategy Agmashenebeli – 13.1%|url=https://georgiatoday.ge/gorbi-if-elections-were-held-this-week-59-3-of-respondents-would-vote-for-gd-unm-strategy-agmashenebeli-13-1/|date=15 April 2024 |website=Georgia Today|language=en-US}}</ref> The IRI published its results without allocating the number of undecided voters.

==Results==
The Georgian Dream managed to secure victory in the election, garnering more than 53.93 percent of the vote, while the four major opposition coalitions which agreed on not cooperating with the Georgian Dream in the parliament through the Georgian Charter, received 37.78% in total. Georgian Dream was strongest in the rural areas but lost the capital Tbilisi and also Rustavi to the opposition, while being relatively close to losing other major cities as well. Georgian Dream was strongest in the [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]], [[Kvemo Kartli]], [[Svaneti]], Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, [[Guria]] and [[Adjara]] regions. In the capital, it received 42% of the vote, while the four major opposition coalitions combined received 46% plus 5.3% of the libertarian Girchi party. Georgian Dream also dramatically lost to the opposition among in the overseas districts among the Georgian diaspora. In [[Mingrelia]], where the opposition parties, particularly the UNM, were strongest in the [[2021 Georgian local elections]] and managed to secure victories in some districts, Georgian Dream managed to turn the tide and won all districts. In contrast to the 2020 parliamentary election, the UNM-led Unity – National Movement coalition declined dramatically, losing half of its votes, partly to the new Coalition for Change alliance, which was established few months prior to the election by former UNM members. The Lelo-led Strong Georgia coalition also managed to improve its results due to inclusion of various small parties in its alliance.<ref name="off">{{Cite news|title= Official Results of 2024 Vote: What They Show |work=[[Civil Georgia]] | url=https://civil.ge/archives/631386|date=28 October 2024 | access-date=27 October 2024}}</ref> Despite this, Georgian Dream failed to attain a supermajority in parliament that would enable them to pass amendments to the constitution banning the main opposition parties.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Georgia opposition calls election results protests as president accuses Russia |work=[[France 24]] | url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241028-georgia-opposition-calls-election-results-protests-as-president-accuses-russia |date=28 October 2024 | access-date=28 October 2024}}</ref> The results were officially certified by the CEC on 16 November.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Georgia's Poll Body Confirms Ruling Party's Contested Vote Win|work=[[The Moscow Times]] | url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/16/georgias-poll-body-confirms-ruling-partys-contested-vote-win-a87032 |date=16 November 2024 | access-date=16 November 2024}}</ref>

=====European Union=====
{{See also|Georgia–European Union relations}}

On 6 October, the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) adopted a resolution on Georgia at its Congress in [[Estoril]], [[Portugal]], condemning "democratic regression and persecution of opposition" under the Georgian Dream government. The resolution called for sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili and his family, opposed the Foreign Agents and anti-LGBT laws, and emphasized the need for free and fair elections and democratic reforms in line with the EU's criteria. It also criticized "political persecution, violence against opposition, and disinformation campaigns", urging the EU to support civil society, strengthen election monitoring, and impose sanctions on "those undermining democracy". ALDE also supported the initiation of EU accession negotiations following democratic reforms.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 October 2024 |title=ALDE Adopts Resolution on Georgia, Calls for Personal Sanctions Against Ivanishvili |url=https://civil.ge/archives/627389 |access-date=9 October 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

On 9 October, the European Parliament adopted the resolution "On the Decline of Democracy and Threats to Political Pluralism in Georgia" with 495 votes in favor and 73 against. The resolution urged the European Union to freeze aid to the Georgian government, impose sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili and other individuals responsible for the "erosion of democracy", and ensure that "anti-democratic laws are aligned with the criteria for visa liberalization".<ref>{{Cite web|date=9 October 2024|title= EP adopts resolution on Georgia |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/ep-adopts-resolution-on-georgia/|language=en}}</ref> Additionally, the draft resolution called on the Georgian government to halt its campaign of "opposition intimidation and anti-Western disinformation, impose sanctions on Russia, release former President Mikheil Saakashvili on humanitarian grounds, and ensure a peaceful transfer of power based on electoral outcomes".<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 October 2024 |title=EP adopts resolution on decline of democracy in Georgia with 495 votes |url=https://georgiatoday.ge/ep-adopts-resolution-on-decline-of-democracy-in-georgia-with-495-votes/ |access-date=9 October 2024 |website=Georgia Today |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Desku |first=Arta |date=9 October 2024 |title=EU Urged to Freeze Funding to Georgia & Suspend Visa-Free Travel Agreement |url=https://schengen.news/eu-urged-to-freeze-funding-to-georgia-suspend-visa-free-travel-agreement/ |access-date=9 October 2024 |website=SchengenNews |language=en}}</ref>

A number of MEPs made supporting statements in favor of resolution. A member of [[Volt Netherlands]], [[Reinier van Lanschot]] said that the upcoming elections "will define Georgia for generations". He said that the democracy in Georgia has been being "attacked" by the Georgian Dream party, which had been "creating a Russian nightmare". He called the Georgian Dream "being afraid of democracy" because "good democracy deals corrupt leaders". He stated that "a new generation of young leaders who can build an open culture and parliamentary democracy" in Georgia "count on our support".<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 October 2024|title=MEP Lanschot: Georgians have chosen to fight for their freedom; we see same fight reflected today in Georgia's civil society|url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-lanschot-georgians-have-chosen-to-fight-for-their-freedom-we-see-same-fight-reflected-today-in-georgias-civil-society/|language=en}}</ref> MEP [[Markéta Gregorová]] said that Georgia was being "taken over" by Russia and urged Europe not to be "too late to the fight". She urged to suspend the EU candidate status and the visa liberalisation for Georgia, while aiding the Georgians who "to lead to fight" against the government.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 October 2024 |title= MEP Gregorová: That is through Georgian citizens and politicians to lead to fight; but we can surely aid them; can we for once be on time?! |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-gregorova-that-is-through-georgian-citizens-and-politicians-to-lead-to-fight-but-we-can-surely-aid-them-can-we-for-once-be-on-time/|access-date=9 October 2024 |website=1tv.ge|language=en}}</ref>

A number of MEPs criticized the resolution. MEP [[Nacho Sánchez Amor]], a member of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], criticized the resolution on grounds that it posed a "risk of being accused of interference" by the Georgian government and Russia, with the resolution serving as a proof.<ref name="sanch">{{Cite web|date=6 October 2024|title=MEP Sánchez: Resolution on Georgia will damage image of EU and our observers, there will be risk of being accused of interference|url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-sanchez-resolution-on-georgia-will-damage-image-of-eu-and-our-observers-there-will-be-risk-of-being-accused-of-interference/|website=1tv.ge|language=en}}</ref> MEP [[Thierry Mariani]], a member of [[National Rally]], said that the resolution was aimed to influence the Georgian elections, and possibly causing [[Maidan]] in Georgia in case of Georgian Dream victory, while noting that only Georgians should decide their future without the interference either from Brussels or Kremlin. Mariani said that the resolution would destabilize the democracy in Georgia in favor of foreign interests.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 October 2024|title= MEP Mariani: Georgians don't want to take orders from Moscow, or advice from Brussels; Georgians alone will choose their future |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-mariani-georgians-dont-want-to-take-orders-from-moscow-or-advice-from-brussels-georgians-alone-will-choose-their-future/|language=en}}</ref> MEP [[Petar Volgin]], a member of [[Revival (Bulgarian political party)|Revival]] party, said that Georgia was being threatened with sanctions for refusing to be a "Euro-Atlantic puppet" and "colony". He said that the same mechanism was working in other countries too, including in his home country [[Bulgaria]], to undermine a national state and promote globalist doctrines.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 October 2024|title= MEP Volgin: EU and US threatened Georgia with sanctions because Georgian government refuses to be puppet of Brussels and Washington|url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-volgin-eu-and-the-u-s-threatened-georgia-with-sanctions-because-georgian-government-refuses-to-be-puppet-of-brussels-and-washington/|language=en}}</ref> MEP [[Danilo Della Valle]], a member of [[Five Star Movement]], said that it was wrong to attempt to manipulate Georgian elections by the EU and USA. He also spoke against "an attempt to impose a certain geopolitical vision on countries, such as Georgia, dictated by NATO and the United States" amid the war in Ukraine.<ref name="valle">{{Cite web|date=8 October 2024|title= MEP Valle: We have to speak out against following blindly NATO and US Policy |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/mep-valle-we-have-to-speak-out-against-following-blindly-nato-and-us-policy/|language=en}}</ref>

=====Germany=====
{{See also|Georgia–Germany relations}}

On 10 October, the German Bundestag adopted resolution called "A European future for Georgia", initiated by the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]. The resolution highlighted the "authoritarian tendencies in the country ahead of crucial elections" and called the German Federal Government to ensure "no further progress occurs in Georgia's EU accession process" until the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence is in place, "take note of any violations that could lead to targeted sanctions" against the Georgian government and advocate for "free and fair parliamentary elections". The [[CDU/CSU]], [[Alternative for Germany]] and [[Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance]] voted against, while [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] abstained.<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 October 2024 |title=Bundestag Adopts Resolution "A European future for Georgia"|url=https://civil.ge/archives/627975|access-date=14 August 2024 |work=Civil Georgia |language=en}}</ref> In response to the resolution, AfD initiated a motion which "opposes regime change policy in Georgia".<ref name="res">{{Cite news |date=13 October 2024 |title=Bundestag Debates Reflect Differences in Parties' Views on Developments in Georgia|url=https://civil.ge/archives/628166|work=Civil Georgia |language=en}}</ref>

Russia claimed that there were "unprecedented attempts at Western interference" in the election and accused Western countries of "trying to twist Georgia's hand" and "dictate terms".<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 October 2024 |title=Georgia votes in high-stakes election affecting EU membership ambitions |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/26/georgia-votes-in-high-stakes-election-affecting-eu-membership-ambitions |work=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

=====United States=====
======Proposed MEGOBARI Act======
{{Main|MEGOBARI Act}}
{{See also|Georgia–United States relations}}
On 11 July 2024, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] progressed a bill titled the [[MEGOBARI Act]] (Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence Act),<ref>{{Cite web |title=H.R.8566 – MEGOBARI Act |url=https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8566/BILLS-118hr8566ih.pdf |website=congress.gov}}</ref> with a vote of 41 to 6. Initiated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Joe Wilson (American politician)|Joe Wilson]], the bill—named after the Georgian word for "friend" ({{lang-ka|მეგობარი|tr}})—addresses "democratic and human rights issues in Georgia" and outlines specific measures for support and oversight. The MEGOBARI Act would emphasize "the U.S. commitment to upholding democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law" in Georgia, acknowledge the progress made by Georgian civil society and stress the need to "strengthen democracy for regional stability and U.S. interests".<ref>{{Cite web |title=MEGOBARI Act reaffirms US's support to Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration, "countering authoritarian regimes" – Helsinki Commission |url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2024/39282#gsc.tab=0 |access-date=14 August 2024 |website=agenda.ge |language=en}}</ref>

The bill responds to recent "democratic backsliding" by calling for increased scrutiny of the Georgian government's actions, particularly "its ties to [[Russia]] and other authoritarian regimes".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Prince |first=Todd |date=23 May 2024 |title=New U.S. Legislation Aims To Dissuade Democratic Backsliding In Georgia |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/megobari-act-georgia-us-sanctions-georgian-dream/32959477.html |access-date=14 August 2024 |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |language=en}}</ref> To ensure accountability, the bill mandates several reports on issues such as "corrupt practices that support Russian interests and evade sanctions, [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian intelligence]] activities, and potential [[China–Georgia relations|Chinese cooperation]]". It also includes sanctions and travel bans on "individuals undermining Georgian democracy". A Democracy Monitoring Task Force will be established to "oversee democratic practices", especially during elections, to "ensure fairness".<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 July 2024 |title=The Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee has passed the MEGOBARI Act supporting Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration.

Georgian opposition representatives have expressed their gratitude to Congressman Wilson for his support, praising the bill's focus on Georgia's sovereignty, democracy, and Euro-Atlantic integration. They urged Congress and the Senate to pass the legislation quickly and requested additional resources and congressional visits to monitor the October parliamentary elections, given the critical nature of this support.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 June 2024 |title=Opposition Parties Plead to the U.S. Congress to Commit Resources for Election Monitoring in Georgia |url=https://civil.ge/archives/611780 |website=[[Civil Georgia]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=6 June 2024 |title=Georgian opposition appeals to Congressman Joe Wilson |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/georgian-opposition-appeals-to-congressman-joe-wilson/ |website=[[Georgian Public Broadcaster]]}}</ref> Conversely, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze criticized the MEGOBARI Act, labeling it as blackmail. He argued that the Act could harm [[Georgia–United States relations|Georgia-U.S. relations]] and criticized the approach of using sanctions and threats. Instead, he called for more constructive and pragmatic discussions to improve bilateral relations.<ref>{{Cite web |date=31 July 2024 |title=PM: MEGOBARI Act conveys blackmail |url=https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/pm-megobari-act-conveys-blackmail/ |website=[[Georgian Public Broadcaster]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=31 July 2024 |title=MEGOBARI Act will not help to reboot the relationship between Georgia and US – PM |url=https://bm.ge/en/news/megobari-act-will-not-help-to-reboot-the-relationship-between-georgia-and-us-pm |access-date=14 August 2024 |website=Business Media |language=en}}</ref> The ruling Georgian Dream party issued a statement, saying that the MEGOBARI Act constituted a "blackmail, intimidation" against the independent Georgian policy and "especially cynical" in light of the Georgian celebration of Independence Day two days before. The party condemned the threat of sanctions against legislators for "voting in favor of a law" and added that this was against the spirit of cooperation between sovereign nations. The party rejected the possibility of following the MEGOBARI Act, saying that "we do not intend to trade on our country's sovereignty and security, and no blackmail whatsoever can force us to go against our country".<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 May 2024 |title=Ruling party says US "policy of blackmail, intimidation" "in contradiction" with strategic partnership|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2024/39276#gsc.tab=0|access-date=14 August 2024 |website=Agenda.ge|language=en}}</ref>

======Sanctions======
On 16 September 2024, the US Department of State announced visa restrictions for 60 "Georgian government officials and others who have undermined Georgia's democracy and the human rights of the Georgian people". These included senior government officials, municipal figures, business leaders, law enforcers, lawmakers etc.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 September 2024 |title=The US Department of State imposed visa sanctions on more than 60 citizens of Georgia |url=https://rustavi2.ge/en/news/291798 |website=[[Rustavi 2]] |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] imposed financial sanctions on 4 Georgian citizens under [[Magnitsky Act]] for "undermining fundamental freedoms". Namely, the Chief of Special Task Department of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia]] Khareba Kharazishvili and his deputy Mileri Lagazauri were sanctioned, along with the leaders of the Conservative Movement/Alt-Info party Zura Makharadze and Konstantine Morgoshia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 September 2024 |title=The US Treasury Department has sanctioned 4 citizens of Georgia |url=https://rustavi2.ge/en/news/291789 |website=[[Rustavi 2]] |language=en}}</ref> Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze called the sanctions on Georgian officials an "insult to Georgian state".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 October 2024 |title=Georgian PM calls US sanctions on Gov't officials "insult to Georgian state" |url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2024/40903 |website=Agenda.ge |language=en}}</ref> On 3 October, the US embassy to Georgia confirmed that Bidzina Ivanishvili was not sanctioned by the US government.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 October 2024 |title=US Embassy rejects media reports on sanctions against Georgian Dream Honorary Chair, family |url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2024/40914 |website=Agenda.ge |language=en}}</ref>

On 20 September, [[Voice of America]] (VoA) reported that the U.S. State Department and Treasury are preparing sanctions against Bidzina Ivanishvili. According to a high-level anonymous source, this marks a significant shift, as the sanctions package is now ready for implementation. However, it is still unclear when these sanctions will be enacted, potentially before or after the elections. One official stated that Ivanishvili had taken steps to deepen ties with [[Russian oligarchs]] and worked to increase Russia's influence in Georgia's market, actions allegedly done under the guidance of Russian intelligence. The sanctions would target these activities under Executive Order 14024, which allows for sanctions related to "harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation". An additional anonymous source familiar with the discussions told VoA that the administration's efforts serve as a signal to the Georgian government, stressing that the U.S. is serious about its concerns. "The [[Joe Biden|Biden]] people are trying to convey the seriousness and hope that somebody in the Georgian government is listening in a serious way," the source explained. While it remains unknown when the sanctions will be implemented, the necessary preparations are in place, with the administration continuing to hope for a shift back toward a more democratic course in Georgia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 September 2024 |title=U.S. Readies Sanctions Against Ivanishvili – Report |url=https://civil.ge/archives/625514 |access-date=9 October 2024 |website=[[Civil Georgia]] |language=en-US}}</ref>
