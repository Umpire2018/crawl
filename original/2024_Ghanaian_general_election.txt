==Electoral system==
The [[President of Ghana]] is elected using the [[two-round system]] while [[Member of parliament|members]] of [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]] are elected in single-member constituencies using [[first-past-the-post voting]]. Both are elected to four-year terms.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ghana: Vote Counting using Majoritatrian and First-Past-the-Post —|url=https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/vc/annex/vcy/vcy_gh|access-date=7 December 2020|website=ACE Project}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/984519/africa-watch-2020-is-election-season-across-afric.html |title=Africa Watch: 2020 Is Election Season Across Africa|first= Franck |last=Kuwonu |date=13 February 2020 |work=Modern Ghana}}</ref>

Eligible voters must be Ghanaian citizens at least 18 years old, except for those declared insane who are disenfranchised.

====Results====
To reduce the number of candidates, the NPP held a Special [[Superdelegate|Super Delegates]] Congress on 26 August 2023, which would select the top five candidates who would then go on to contest in the final primaries in November. Vice President [[Mahamudu Bawumia]] placed first, with 68% of the votes. To the surprise of many observers, "maverick" MP [[Kennedy Agyapong]], running a campaign largely critical of the Akufo-Addo administration, placed second, edging out NPP veteran [[Alan John Kyerematen|Alan John Kyeremanten]], who first ran for President in [[2008 Ghanaian general election|2008]]. [[Owusu Afriyie Akoto]] placed fourth, while [[Francis Addai-Nimoh]] and [[Boakye Agyarko]] tied for fifth place, necessitating a run-off, which Addai-Nimoh won, rounding out the five final candidates for the primaries.<ref>{{cite news |title=NPP Super Delegates Conference: Regional break down of the results |url=https://citinewsroom.com/2023/08/npp-super-delegates-conference-results-from-voting-centres/ |access-date=28 November 2023 |work=Citinewsroom - Comprehensive News in Ghana |date=26 August 2023}}</ref> However, Kyeremanten announced that he would withdraw from the primaries (later leaving the NPP entirely and launching his own third-party campaign), leaving four candidates.<ref name="graphic3">{{cite news |last1=Frimpong |first1=Enoch Darfah |title=Alan Kyerematen quits NPP again, decides to contest 2024 as independent candidate |url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/politics/it-is-now-official-alan-kyerematen-is-going-into-2024-as-independent-presidential-candidate.html |access-date=28 November 2023 |work=[[Daily Graphic]] |date=24 September 2023}}</ref>
