== Background ==
[[Gofa Zone|Gofa]] is situated in [[South Ethiopia Regional State]], approximately {{Convert|450|km|mi}} from the capital [[Addis Ababa]], a journey that takes around 10 hours by car. According to statements from locals, the area where the [[landslides]] occurred was rural, remote, and mountainous. The soil in the region is known to be unstable, and landslides and heavy rains lead to deadly incidents every year.<ref name="alarabiya 23jul" /> In 2016, heavy rains in [[Wolayita Zone|Wolaita]], also in South Ethiopia, led to landslides which killed 41 people.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-23 |title=More than 200 die in southern Ethiopia landslides |url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240723-more-than-200-die-in-southern-ethiopia-landslides |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=France 24 |language=en |archive-date=24 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240724205026/https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240723-more-than-200-die-in-southern-ethiopia-landslides |url-status=live }}</ref> In May 2024, 50 people were killed in a landslide in the same area as the July event.<ref name="scramble"/>
