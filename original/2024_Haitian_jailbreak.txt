{{Campaignbox Gang war in Haiti}}

Amid the [[Haitian crisis (2018–present)|unrest in Haiti since 2018]], armed gangs stormed [[Haiti]]'s two largest prisons in March 2024, resulting in more than 4,700 inmates escaping. The gangs demanded that prime minister [[Ariel Henry]] resign, attacking and closing [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]] and preventing Henry from entering the country. The Haitian government declared a 72-hour [[state of emergency]] and a nighttime [[curfew]] in [[Ouest Department]] in an attempt to curb the violence and chaos. On 12 March 2024, Henry indicated his intention to resign as prime minister in response to the deteriorating security situation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hu |first=Caitlin Stephen |date=2024-03-12 |title=Haiti's leader to resign as gangs run rampant through country engulfed in crisis |url=https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/americas/haiti-pm-ariel-henry-resigns-gang-violence-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=2024-03-12 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

== Background ==
Haiti has been undergoing a [[Haitian crisis (2018–present)|crisis since 2018]], including political assassinations and a [[Gang war in Haiti|gang war since 2023]].

On 1 March 2024, Haitian prime minister Ariel Henry signed an agreement in Nairobi, [[Kenya]] attempting to allow the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti.<ref name="4-Guardian">{{cite news |publisher=Guardian News & Media |title=Kenya signs deal in attempt to rescue plan for deployment of 1,000 police officers to Haiti |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/01/haiti-police-officers |access-date=4 March 2024 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 March 2024}}</ref>

== Events ==
[[Jimmy Chérizier]], the leader of the "G9 Family and Allies" gang in Port-au-Prince, released a video announcing his intention to prevent Ariel Henry from returning to Haiti with the operation. On 1 March, when asked if it was safe for him to return to Haiti, Henry shrugged.<ref name="AP-4-2">{{cite news |last=Coto |first=Dánica |date=4 March 2024 |title=There's chaos in Haiti.
