===Operations at Haneda Airport===
Although all occupants on the Airbus A350 were evacuated with few minor injuries, the plane was destroyed in the post-crash fire and was written off, with Japan Airlines estimating the operational losses from its hull loss at 15 billion yen ($105 million), which is set to be covered by insurance.<ref name="kyodofcd" /> The aircraft following immediately behind Flight 516—JAL166, a [[Boeing 737-800]] approaching runway 34R—had to perform a [[go-around]] at {{convert|1150|ft}} before diverting to [[Narita International Airport]]. There were also several flights waiting for takeoff; most returned to the terminal after the runways were closed.<ref name="FR24Blog_2024-01-03"/>

The accident occurred as millions were traveling for the [[Public holidays in Japan|New Year]] holidays, one of the busiest travel periods of the year. All runways at Haneda Airport were temporarily closed following the accident, and many flights were diverted to nearby Narita Airport, as well as [[Chubu Centrair International Airport]] and [[Kansai International Airport]].<ref name="reuters_clearing_wreckage"/><ref>{{Cite news |date=2 January 2024 |title=Five dead after Japan Airlines jet collides with coast guard plane at Haneda Airport |language=en |work=The Japan Times |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/01/02/japan/haneda-airport-fire/ |access-date=2 January 2024 |archive-date=2 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240102092145/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/01/02/japan/haneda-airport-fire/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Others were cancelled as the result of the accident,<ref name="NHK20240102RB">{{Cite web |last= |date=2 January 2024 |title= |script-title=ja:【中継・速報】日本航空の機体炎上"全員脱出"海保機は不明も |trans-title=[Relay / Breaking news] Two of the six crew members of the Japan Coast Guard plane are dead, the captain is in critical condition, Japan Airlines Flight 516 from New Chitose to Haneda, which is thought to have been involved in a collision, also burst into flames at Haneda Airport.

Moreover, it was revealed that over 100 emergency vehicles were waiting to enter the airport and several ambulances carrying injured passengers were unable to leave for about 30 minutes. For future measures, the ministry is scheduled to revise its emergency guidance by August and also requested the number of airport staff that are available to respond to such emergencies on holidays and at night be increased.<ref name="NHK6"/><ref name="Yomiuri6">{{Cite web |date=2024-06-28 |title=羽田衝突事故時、負傷者乗せた救急車３０分出発できず…緊急車両を誘導するチーム新設など体制強化へ |trans-title=Ambulances carrying injured passengers were unable to leave for 30 minutes after Haneda crash...New team to guide emergency vehicles and other measures to strengthen system |url=https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20240628-OYT1T50165/ |access-date=2024-06-28 |website=Yomiuri Shimbun |language=ja |archive-date=28 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240628150802/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20240628-OYT1T50165/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

A progress report was released by the Japan Transport Safety Board on 25 December. The report indicated that the captain of the Coast Guard aircraft mistook air traffic control's instruction when their aircraft was told that they were "number one," and entered runway 34R believing that takeoff clearance was given. The report added that neither the controller in charge nor the JAL pilots noticed that the Coast Guard aircraft entered the runway, and that the three circumstances combined resulted in the accident. It also provided details on the evacuation of the JAL plane, and the actions of its pilots and cabin crew.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20241225_11/ |title=Captain of plane in Haneda collision says he mistook controller instructions |date=25 December 2024 |publisher=NHK World-Japan |access-date=25 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241225184755/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20241225_11/ |archive-date=25 December 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15565047 |title=JAL crew saved everyone aboard in Jan. 2 crash despite chaos |date=25 December 2024 |access-date=25 December 2024 |last=Nagano |first=Yusuke |work=The Asahi Shimbun}}</ref><ref name="yearly report">{{cite web |author=運輸安全委員会（航空部会）(Japan Transport Safety Board (Aviation Division)) |date=2024-12-25 |title=海上保安庁所属ボンバルディア式ＤＨＣ－８－３１５型ＪＡ７２２Ａ及び日本航空株式会社所属エアバス式Ａ３５０－９４１型ＪＡ１３ＸＪの航空事故調査について（経過報告） |trans-title="Progress report on the investigation into the aviation accident involving the Japan Coast Guard's Bombardier DHC-8-315 JA722A and Japan Airlines' Airbus A350-941 JA13XJ" |url=https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/aircraft/rep-acci/keika20241225-JA722A_JA13XJ.pdf |access-date=2024-12-26 |language=ja}}</ref>
