The '''2024 Irish general election''' to elect the [[34th Dáil]] took place on Friday, 29 November 2024, following the [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] of the [[33rd Dáil]] on 8 November by [[president of Ireland|President]] [[Michael D. Higgins]] at the request of [[Taoiseach]] [[Simon Harris]]. Polls were open from 7&nbsp;a.m. to 10&nbsp;p.m [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. It elected 174 [[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]] (TDs) across 43 [[Dáil constituencies|constituencies]] of between 3 and 5 seats to [[Dáil Éireann]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Oireachtas]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[legislature]]. Under the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023]], the number of TDs was increased from 160 to 174, making it the largest Dáil in the history of the state, with an increase in the number of constituencies from 39 to 43. The main issues in the campaign were the cost of living, [[Homelessness in Ireland|housing affordability and availability]], [[Irish anti-immigration protests|immigration and asylum management]], and [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|economic stability]] amid external trade uncertainties, reflecting voter concerns despite the country's strong overall financial health.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 November 2024|title=Irish election 2024: Will cost of living decide who wins? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxvdy58qxno |access-date=24 November 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241124102742/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxvdy58qxno |archive-date=24 November 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=24 November 2024 |title=Ireland's election: the parties, the voting, the issues and the likely result |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/irelands-election-the-parties-the-voting-the-issues-and-the-likely-result |access-date=24 November 2024|website=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241124104429/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/irelands-election-the-parties-the-voting-the-issues-and-the-likely-result |archive-date=24 November 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=24 November 2024|title=What to know about the Irish election – including polling and issues |url=https://news.sky.com/story/what-to-know-about-the-irish-election-including-polling-and-issues-13257323 |access-date=24 November 2024|website=Sky News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241124104955/https://news.sky.com/story/what-to-know-about-the-irish-election-including-polling-and-issues-13257323 |archive-date=24 November 2024 }}</ref>

==Electoral system==
{{main|Single transferable vote}}
Under the system of [[single transferable vote]] (STV), each voter may mark any number of the candidates in order of preference. The quota is determined at the first count in each constituency by dividing the number of valid ballots by one more than the number of seats (for example, a quarter of the valid ballots in a three-seat constituency, a fifth of those in a four-seat constituency, and a sixth of those in a five-seat constituency) and ''then'' adding one vote – thus determining the number of votes that may be attained by ''only'' the number of seats to be filled. Any candidate reaching or exceeding the quota is elected.<ref>{{cite report |title=A Guide to Ireland's PR-STV Voting System |publisher=Ireland Department of Housing, Planning & Local Government |date=November 2018 |url=https://assets.gov.ie/111110/03f591cc-6312-4b21-8193-d4150169480e.pdf}}</ref>

If in the first count fewer candidates reach the quota than the number of seats to be filled, if any successful candidates have more votes than the quota, their surplus is distributed to remaining candidates based on the next usable marked preference on the ballot papers. If still it happens that fewer candidates have reached the quota than the number of seats to be filled, the last-placed candidate is excluded from the count and those ballot papers are transferred to the next usable marked preference. This is repeated until sufficient candidates have reached the quota to fill the available seats, or where a seat remains to be filled in a constituency and no candidate is capable of achieving a quota as there is nobody left to eliminate for a distribution, then the highest place candidate, even if not having quota, is deemed elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2153_B.htm|title=Dáil Éireann (House of Representatives)|work=Inter-Parliamentary Union|access-date=24 March 2019|archive-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307215059/http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2153_B.htm|url-status=live}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/23/enacted/en/html|title=Electoral Act 1992 [Part XIX]|date=5 November 1992|access-date=15 January 2020|website=Irish Statute Book|archive-date=14 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114042407/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/23/enacted/en/html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the first week of canvassing, the [[BBC]] suggested the primary issues in the campaign were the housing crisis, strained healthcare services, the rising cost of living, concerns over public spending and immigration reform.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sharkey |first=Kevin |date=17 November 2024 |title=Were politicians dancing around issues ahead of Irish election? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2041z03x2o |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=21 November 2024}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' has suggested the main campaign issues are the cost of living, housing, healthcare funding, immigration, and the use of a €14 billion tax windfall following the resolution of [[Apple's EU tax dispute]].

In addition to the criticism Fine Gael received due to their selection of [[John McGahon]] as a candidate, the party were also challenged during the campaign on their handling of Patsy O'Brien, a Mayo candidate expelled from the party in 2020 for sending inappropriate messages to a party staff member. Fine Gael cited privacy concerns for not disclosing the reason at the time, while opposition parties accused Fine Gael of hypocrisy, noting Fine Gael's call for political accountability during the campaign.

On 22 November, during the final weekend of the campaign, Simon Harris walked away from an emotional exchange with Charlotte Fallon, a carer from St Joseph's Foundation, in [[Kanturk]], [[County Cork]]. Fallon, a worker in a section 39 disability organisation, accused the government of neglecting carers and people with disabilities. Harris dismissed her claims, leading to a tense exchange and his abrupt departure after she called him "not a good man". The incident, captured on video by RTÉ News, drew criticism from activists and opposition politicians who condemned Harris for his dismissive response. Fallon later said she felt "shaken" and upset. Harris rang her the following morning to apologise, admitting he had been "harsh" and should have given her more time. Fine Gael deputy leader Helen McEntee defended Harris, citing the long day of campaigning.<ref name="Harris Kanturk Times">{{cite news |last=Bray |first=Jennifer |date=23 November 2024 |title=Disability worker says she was 'shaken' and in tears after exchange with Simon Harris |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/23/disability-worker-says-she-was-shaken-and-in-tears-after-exchange-with-fine-gael-leader-simon-harris-in-kanturk/ |work=[[Irish Times]] |location= |access-date=23 November 2024}}</ref><ref name="Harris Kanturk Journal">{{cite news |last=Maguire |first=Mairead  |date=23 November 2024 |title=Carer at the centre of viral video of her confronting Taoiseach says she felt 'shaken' |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-harris-general-election-carers-criticism-6551100-Nov2024/ |work=[[TheJournal.ie]] |location= |access-date=23 November 2024}}</ref>

On 23 November [[Philip Sutcliffe Snr]], a councillor for [[Independent Ireland]] and candidate for [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]], quit the party after controversy arose over his association with [[Conor McGregor]] following McGregor being found liable for rape in a civil trial.

On 26 November, the ''[[Irish Daily Mirror]]'' alleged that on 22 November Fine Gael had pressured [[RTÉ News]] on how the video of Simon Harris in Kanturk would be framed.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 November 2024 |title=Fine Gael in scramble to RTÉ before care worker video aired |url=https://evoke.ie/2024/11/26/news/irish-news/fine-gael-scramble-rte-care-worker-video |work= |location= |access-date=26 November 2024}}</ref> Later the same day, Fine Gael confirmed that contact had been made between the party and RTÉ, but insisted that communication between political party press offices and RTÉ was routine and a daily occurrence throughout the campaign. Mary Lou McDonald called the interaction "chilling" (recalling the same remark made by Simon Harris earlier in the campaign towards Sinn Féin) while [[Gary Gannon]] of the Social Democrats stated "The Taoiseach cannot have his cake and eat it. There were all sorts of videos put out of him dancing at the start of the campaign. We hear him talking a lot about a new energy but what was clearly lacking was a new empathy".<ref>{{cite news |last=Regan |first=Mary |date=26 November 2024 |title=Contact with RTÉ over carer exchange 'normal' – Harris |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/election-24/2024/1126/1483108-harris-rte-election/ |work=[[RTÉ News]] |access-date=26 November 2024}}</ref> How the political parties interact with the media has been another issue in the campaign. On 19 November during the launch of Sinn Féin's manifesto, it was noted by journalists that the manifesto contained a pledge to investigate RTÉ News coverage of the [[Gaza war]] if Sinn Féin enters government. Harris called the measure "chilling" while journalists from several Irish news outlets and the [[National Union of Journalists]] expressed deep concern about political interference in news coverage.<ref>{{multiref2

===Television debates===
[[RTÉ]] hosted two leaders' debates. The first, on 18 November, featured the leaders of ten political parties, and was the largest leaders' debate in Irish history. The second, on 26 November, featured the leaders of the three largest parties: Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin.<ref name=RTE_20241111>{{cite web|title=RTÉ announces comprehensive 2024 General Election coverage across TV, Radio, and Online to keep Ireland inform|website=RTÉ|date=11 November 2024|url=https://about.rte.ie/2024/11/11/rte-announces-comprehensive-2024-general-election-coverage-across-tv-radio-and-online-to-keep-ireland-inform/|access-date=11 November 2024}}</ref>

Three interviews were conducted on Virgin Media ONE with Collete Fitzpatrick with the leaders of the largest three parties: Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin.

====18 November debate====
''[[The Irish Times]]'' stated the key issues discussed in the 18 November debate were housing, cost-of-living pressures, and healthcare, alongside broader questions of governance and political accountability. Housing dominated as the central topic, with Sinn Féin criticising government schemes like Help to Buy and First Homes, while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil defended their approach. Mary Lou McDonald proposed that stamp duty should be abolished for new buyers. Another topic was how Apple's €14 billion tax payment should be spent. Leaders acknowledged the potential for this to be a "pocketbook election", with housing symbolising broader economic frustrations. During the debate, Fine Gael was criticised by Sinn Féin for running [[John McGahon]] as a candidate, who had been found liable for assault in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]]. Taoiseach Simon Harris stood by McGahon, citing that he had been found not guilty in a trial in the Dundalk Circuit Criminal Court. Harris retorted that Sinn Féin "press officer is in prison tonight"; a reference to the recent conviction in Northern Ireland of Michael McMonagle for child sex offences.<ref name="Bray 18 Nov Debate">{{cite news |last=Bray |first=Jennifer |date=18 November 2024 |title='How dare you': Five key moments from the election debate as sparks fly between party leaders |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/18/election-debate-five-key-moments-as-sparks-fly-between-party-leaders/ |work=[[Irish Times]] |location= |access-date=21 November 2024}}</ref><ref name="JHJ Nov 18 Debate">{{cite news |last=Horgan-Jones|first=Jack |date=18 November 2024 |title=What did we learn from the election debate? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/19/in-a-political-melee-the-odds-favour-those-who-are-already-strong-while-other-party-leaders-struggle-for-oxygen/ |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |access-date=21 November 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=8 November 2024 |title=Michael McMonagle jailed for child sex offences |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g18r29djo |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=21 November 2024}}</ref>

The smaller political parties focused on key issues like governance and policy direction. Independent Ireland's Michael Collins said his party would talk to anyone who would priorise their agenda while People Before Profit's Richard Boyd Barrett advocated for a left-leaning government, rejecting any support for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Joan Collins of Right to Change highlighted public frustration with the two dominant parties and their handling of the housing and health crises. Labour's Ivana Bacik stressed the importance of a centre-left platform and constructive change, while Cian O'Callaghan of the Social Democrats made clear that any government must address housing issues. Aontú's Peadar Tóibín distanced his party from Fine Gael and the Greens but was open to Fianna Fáil, while Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman underscored that the Greens' participation in any coalition would depend on prioritising green policies.<ref name="Bray 18 Nov Debate"/><ref name="JHJ Nov 18 Debate"/>

On 1 November, [[Coimisiún na Meán]] announced the lifting of the reporting moratorium that had been in place since 1997, and which had prevented election coverage from 14:00 on the day prior to the election until the close of polls. However, the agency also advised broadcasters not to report on opinion polls or exit polls while voting is underway.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2024/1101/1478553-moratorium-rule/ |title=Broadcast moratorium rule for general elections to be scrapped |publisher=[[RTÉ News]] |date=1 November 2024|access-date=8 November 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnam.ie/coimisiun-na-mean-removes-traditional-broadcast-moratorium-for-election-coverage/ |title=Coimisiún na Meán removes traditional broadcast moratorium for election coverage |publisher=[[Coimisiún na Meán]] |date=1 November 2024|access-date=8 November 2024}}</ref>

Various organisations conduct regular opinion polls to gauge voting intentions. Results of such polls are displayed in the graph below.

The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2020 Irish general election|previous general election]], held on 8 February 2020, to the close of poll for the 2024 general election.

<!-- Talk page consensus is to include Ireland Thinks polls conducted for the Irish Daily Mail; and to NOT add "events" such as party leadership changes. -->
<!--
PLEASE READ THIS!

Opinion polls are listed by default in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER - latest first - but users can sort the table. To preserve the ability to sort by polling date, please include an entry for data-sort-value in front of the polling date. The date we use is the last date of polling, *NOT* the date of publication.

To preserve the ability to sort by the polling company, please increment the relevant data-sort-value by one each time you add a new poll. So a new Behaviour & Attitudes poll would become "B&A14" if the last one was "B&A13".

Please also wikilink the most recent poll (link goes to the publishing media outlet, piped to show the commissioning publisher and polling company) and please also unlink the prior poll from that company.

Please only include polls if you have a reference. Add references to the group="p", not in general references. Please follow the form of citations already used in the article, and definitely *don't* use bare references.

If the above doesn't make sense to you, please do not make major changes.

PLEASE READ THE ABOVE!

[[Violet-Anne Wynne]] and [[Patricia Ryan (politician)|Patricia Ryan]] were elected as Sinn Féin TDs in 2020. However, both left the party before the election, running as independents. The 2024 election saw their first preference votes evaporate, with Wynne's diminishing by 96% and Ryan's by 93%, and both were eliminated extremely early. Some political commentators have suggested these might have been the greatest drops in first preference votes in Irish political history.<ref>{{cite news|date=30 November 2024 |title=2024 Clare general election results |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/election-24/results/#/clare |work=[[RTÉ News]]|access-date=30 November 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=30 November 2024 |title=2024 Kildare South general election results |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/election-24/results/#/kildare-south |work=[[RTÉ News]]|access-date=30 November 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=MacRedmond |first=David |date=1 December 2024 |title=Two independents who quit Sinn Féin as TDs see support fall off a cliff  |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/patricia-ryan-violet-anne-wynne-former-sinn-fein-lose-votes-clare-kildare-6558777-Nov2024/ |work=[[TheJournal.ie]] |location= |access-date=1 December 2024}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
[[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]] won a combined 86 seats, just two short of the 88 required for a majority. Political commentators suggested that these parties could form a government, either as a minority government supported by [[Independent politician (Ireland)|independents]], or in coalition with [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] or the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ireland's election is over, but the country faces weeks of talks before there's a government |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/irelands-election-faces-weeks-talks-gets-government-116378298 |access-date=2024-12-03 |website=ABC News |language=en}}</ref>

[[Sinn Féin]], which increased its number of seats from 37 to 39, has begun negotiating with the same two parties to form a left-wing minority government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fianna Fail largest party in Ireland as counting finishes |url=https://news.sky.com/story/fianna-fail-largest-party-in-ireland-as-counting-finishes-with-coalition-negotiations-set-to-begin-13265657 |access-date=2024-12-03 |website=Sky News |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] lost all but one of its 12 TDs, making it one of the heaviest defeats suffered by the party in its history. Only the party leader, Roderic O'Gorman, retained his seat.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/irish-greens-face-virtual-wipeout-after-general-election-rout|title=Irish Greens virtually wiped out in general election rout|date=1 December 2024|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 December 2024}}</ref>

The [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] had their best election result to date, increasing their number of seats from 6 to 11. Party leader [[Holly Cairns]], who won re-election in Cork South-West, will be on maternity leave for the first six months of the term as she gave birth to a daughter on election day, making her the first Irish party leader to give birth while in office. Party deputy leader [[Cian O'Callaghan]] stepped in as interim party leader in her absence.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jade |date=16 June 2024|title=Holly Cairns could 'potentially' pause maternity leave during general election |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/06/16/holly-cairns-could-potentially-pause-maternity-leave-during-general-election/ |access-date=16 June 2024 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] increased its number of seats from six to 11. In a statement released after the election, Labour stated that it would only enter government with a "progressive, left-of-centre bloc with like-minded parties", as well as outlining their basic platform for negotiation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement from the Labour Party |date=5 December 2024 |url=https://labour.ie/news/2024/12/05/statement-from-the-labour-party-2/ |work=The Labour Party |access-date=6 December 2024}}</ref> On 19 December, Labour stated that it would not join a coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.<ref>{{cite web |title=Irish Labour Party rules out junior role in next coalition |date=19 December 2024 |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/irish-labour-party-rules-out-junior-role-next-coalition-2024-12-19/ |work=Reuters |access-date=21 December 2024}}</ref> 

On 17 December, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael agreed to support [[Verona Murphy]]'s candidacy for the position of [[Ceann Comhairle]], in order to facilitate government formation talks between the two parties and the Regional Independent Group, of which Murphy was a member.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Jane Matthews |author2=Christina Finn |date=2024-12-17 |title=FF and FG parliamentary parties agree to back Independent Verona Murphy as Ceann Comhairle |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/government-formation-january-6573664-Dec2024/ |access-date=2024-12-18 |website=TheJournal.ie |language=en}}</ref> The 34th Dáil met for the first time the next day and she was elected on the third count.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Independent TD Verona Murphy elected as first female Ceann Comhairle |url=https://www.westernpeople.ie/independent-td-verona-murphy-elected-as-first-female-ceann-comhairle_arid-41899.html |access-date=2024-12-18 |website=Western People |language=en}}</ref>

Negotiations on the formation of a coalition government continued over the Christmas and New Year period. On 15 January 2025, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to form a coalition government consisting of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and a number of independents from the Independent and Regional Independents technical groups, with Micheál Martin to be nominated as Taoiseach and Simon Harris as [[Tánaiste]], and with three independent TDs to receive junior ministries. A programme for government was published later that day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/vat-rate-for-food-led-hospitality-sector-to-be-cut-to-9-6594055-Jan2025/|title=Simon Harris likely to take beefed up Foreign Affairs role as PfG details revealed|last=Pepper|first=Diarmuid|publisher=The Journal|date=15 January 2025|access-date=17 January 2025}}</ref> Controversy arose in the following days when it was announced that some of those independents who were supporting the new government's formation but would not be receiving ministries were seeking to form a Dáil technical group to retain opposition speaking time. This was condemned by opposition parties, with Sinn Féin threatening legal action if Verona Murphy, the Ceann Comhairle—who prior to her election to that office had been a member of that same technical group—permitted this to happen.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2025/0117/1491340-ireland-politics/|title=Sinn Féin seeks legal advice over Regional Independents' speaking rights bid|last=Ó Cionnaith|first=Fiachra|publisher=RTÉ News|date=17 January 2025|access-date=17 January 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2025/0116/1491332-dail-grouping-row/|title=Regional Independents make 'outrageous' bid for opposition Dáil rights|last=Regan|first=Mary|publisher=RTÉ News|date=16 January 2025|access-date=17 January 2025}}</ref> 

The Dáil resumed on 22 January, but [[2025 Dáil Éireann speaking rights dispute|procedural disputes over the technical group issue]] overshadowed events, resulting in chaotic scenes as the Dáil was suspended four times, with no nominations for Taoiseach being taken. Aontú resigned from the Regional Independent Group, and joined the Independent Group.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2025/0122/1492167-government-ireland/|title=Dáil adjourned until tomorrow amid chaotic scenes|publisher=RTÉ News|date=22 January 2025|access-date=22 January 2025}}</ref> On 23 January, Micheál Martin was elected again as Taoiseach in a 95-76 vote by the Dáil.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Micheál Martin returns as Ireland’s prime minister after securing backing of parliament |url=https://apnews.com/article/ireland-micheal-martin-taoiseach-return-eab53d572e0400715276f89b962d92d5 |website=AP News |date=23 January 2025}}</ref>
