General elections were held in [[Japan]] on 27 October 2024 due to the early dissolution of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]] of the [[National Diet]], by Prime Minister [[Shigeru Ishiba]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-29 |title=自民･石破総裁 あす衆院解散の意向を表明へ 総選挙１０月１５日公示、２７日投開票で最終調整｜FNNプライムオンライン |url=https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/765671 |access-date=2024-09-29 |website=FNNプライムオンライン |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240929130724/https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/765671 |archive-date=2024-09-29 |url-status=live}}</ref> Voting took place in [[List of districts of the House of Representatives of Japan|all constituencies]], including [[Proportional representation|proportional]] blocks, to elect all 465 members of the House of Representatives.

The election was held one month after Ishiba took office as prime minister, after winning a heated contest in the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) [[2024 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) presidential election|presidential election]] on 27 September, following the resignation of [[Fumio Kishida]] as party leader due to his low approval rating amid the [[2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal|party-wide slush fund corruption scandal]]. The dissolution of the Diet was held eight days after the prime minister's inauguration and 26 days before the voting day, both the shortest since the end of [[World War II]].

Amid continued public discontent with the slush fund scandal, the governing LDP and its coalition partner [[New Komeito Party|Komeito]] lost their parliamentary majority in the lower house for the first time since [[2009 Japanese general election|2009]], with the LDP suffering its second-worst result in its history, securing only 191 seats. The [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|Constitutional Democratic Party]] (CDP), the main opposition party led by former Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]], achieved its best result in its history, increasing its seat count from 96 to 148. This was the first general election in Japan since [[1955 Japanese general election|1955]] wherein no party secured at least 200 seats.

The [[Democratic Party for the People]] (DPP) won 28 seats, surpassing Komeito to become the fourth-largest party in the chamber. The DPP emerged as a key player in the aftermath of the election as the LDP sought to negotiate their cooperation on a policy-by-policy basis in the next Diet session given the LDP's lack of a majority. Komeito suffered further losses including losing all of its seats in [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]] at the expense of the Osaka-based [[Ishin no Kai]] as well as the party's newly elected leader [[Keiichi Ishii]] losing his seat. Smaller opposition parties also gained seats, including left-wing populist party [[Reiwa Shinsengumi]], right-wing populist party [[Sanseitō]] and the newly-formed far-right [[Conservative Party of Japan|Conservative Party]].

Ishiba was re-elected Prime Minister in the Diet on 11 November as head of an LDP-Komeito [[minority government]].

On 30 September 2024, former [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|Minister of Defense]] [[Shigeru Ishiba]], who won the heated nine-way contest in the [[2024 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) presidential election|party presidential election]] on 27 September, officially announced that he would call an early election to be held on 27 October, a year ahead of the expiration of the current term, to seek confidence from the people. After his inauguration as the prime minister on 1 October, the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] was dissolved on 9 October, with the election being announced on the 15th, and voting to take place on the 27th.<ref name=announcement>{{cite news|title=【放送中】衆議院解散 事実上の選挙戦に 15日公示 27日投開票|date=2024-10-09|work=NHK|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241009/k10014604921000.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241009084240/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241009/k10014604921000.html |archive-date=2024-10-09 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The election is held after the replacement of major party leaders. The LDP elected Ishiba as new leader on 27 September, the [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|Constitutional Democratic Party]] (CDP) elected former Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] [[2024 Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan presidential election|on 23 September]], [[Nobuyuki Baba]] took leadership of [[Japan Innovation Party]] on 30 November 2021, [[Keiichi Ishii]] was elected leader of [[Komeito]] on 28 September, and [[Tomoko Tamura]] became leader of the [[Japanese Communist Party]] (JCP) on 18 January 2024. It is the first time since [[2012 Japanese general election|2012]] where all three of the leading parties in the Diet have had new leadership entering the next election.

The regular election to the [[House of Councillors]], the other house of the national legislature which cannot be dissolved and is thus on fixed terms, [[2025 Japanese House of Councillors election|will take place in 2025]]; but, also on 27 October, [[2024 Japanese by-elections|a by-election]] to the House of Councillors will be held in Iwate. On the prefectural level, the gubernatorial elections in Toyama and Okayama had already been set for 27 October. This was the first dissolution of the Diet since 14 October 2021. The dissolution was eight days after the prime minister's inauguration and the voting and counting 26 days later that, both the shortest since the end of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|title=衆院解散とは 首相就任から8日後は戦後最短|work=日本経済新聞|date=2024-10-10|url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA092DR0Z01C24A0000000/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026041353/https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA092DR0Z01C24A0000000/ |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
The 465 seats of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] are contested via [[parallel voting]]. Of these, 289 members are elected in single-member constituencies using [[first-past-the-post voting]], while 176 members are elected in 11 multi-member constituencies via party list proportional representation. Candidates from parties with legal political [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]], which requires either ≥5 Diet members or ≥1 Diet member and ≥2% of the nationwide vote in one tier of a recent national election, are allowed to stand in a constituency and be present on the party list. If they lose their constituency vote, they may still be elected in the proportionally allocated seats. However, if such a dual candidate wins less than 10% of the vote in their majoritarian constituency, they are also disqualified as a proportional candidate.

On 6 October, Shigeru Ishiba indicated that he would not endorse any lawmakers who have been suspended from party membership over the [[2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal|LDP slush fund scandal]]. Ishiba also indicated that those who had involved scandal, whether they had been sanctioned or not, would be banned from running double candidacy in single-seat districts and proportional representation blocs, which was expected to affect at least 30 such candidates.<ref name="不記載">{{cite news|title=石破首相 不記載で「党員資格停止」の議員など非公認の方針|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241006/k10014602421000.html|work=NHK|date=2024-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241006061401/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241006/k10014602421000.html |archive-date=2024-10-06 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained that it was a response to the "criticism and anger" of the public which were stronger than they expected.<ref>{{cite news|title=石破首相 "非公認は選挙で勝利する観点" 野党側は批判強める|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241008/k10014603671000.html|work=NHK|date=2024-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007214123/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241008/k10014603671000.html |archive-date=2024-10-07 |url-status=live}}</ref>

After holding talks with the right-leaning Nippon Ishin no Kai leader Nobuyuki Baba and [[Democratic Party for the People]] (DPP) leader [[Yuichiro Tamaki]] on 3 October in an attempt to unifying opposition candidates for constituencies to prevent the LDP and its Komeito ally from securing a majority, CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda on 4 October switched his stance to aiming to form a government on its own by filling more candidates in the proportional representation blocks.<ref>{{cite news|title=CDP Calls for Unifying Opposition Candidates in Lower House Poll|url=https://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&k=2024100300698|work=Jiji Press|date=2024-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007091727/https://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&k=2024100300698 |archive-date=2024-10-07 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=立民 野田代表 衆院選で"比例代表含め単独での政権目指す"|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241004/k10014600961000.html|date=2024-10-04|work=NHK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241004063452/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241004/k10014600961000.html |archive-date=2024-10-04 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The CDP and the left-wing pacifist JCP also had differences over their stances on the [[2015 Japanese military legislation|security-related laws]], as Noda aimed at winning over "moderate conservatives" critical of the LDP government, by formulating more middle-of-the-road foreign policy and security measures including the continuation of the laws, while the JCP, which was fielding as many as 216 candidates in the single-seat constituencies, advocated for the repeal of the laws under the banner of the opposition coalition during the [[2016 Japanese House of Councillors election|2016 House of Councillors election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=立民・野田氏、野党共闘で共産と溝 政権担当能力強調も 「隠れ立憲共産」火種に|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241010-O74O2Q2ZGNMM5PRLLL7KMQDUFQ/?outputType=theme_election2024|date=2024-10-10|work=産経新聞|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026042925/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241010-O74O2Q2ZGNMM5PRLLL7KMQDUFQ/?outputType=theme_election2024 |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[The Nikkei]]'' on 11 October reported that the opposition could only manage to have 55 constituencies where they would be a one-on-one battle with the LDP, under 20% of the 289 single-seat constituencies as compared to the 140 constituencies in the [[2021 Japanese general election|previous election in 2021]]. There would be 81 constituencies where CDP, Ishin and other parties compete, and 67 where CDP competes with opposition parties other than Ishin.<ref>{{cite news|title=立民、選挙区調整進まず 与野党一騎打ちは2割どまり|url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA07APC0X01C24A0000000/|date=2024-10-11|work=日本経済新聞|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026043004/https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA07APC0X01C24A0000000/ |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 3 October, [[Seiji Maehara]], leader of the [[Free Education For All]] which commanded four seats in the Diet, announced that his party would join the Nippon Ishin no Kai after months of talks for merger and would run as Ishin-endorsed candidates in the upcoming election. However, House of Representatives member [[Atsushi Suzuki]], who would run in the [[Kanagawa 18th district]], did not join the party, due to its competition with a Ishin candidate in the same constituency.

==Campaign==
A week before the election, a [[Kyodo News]] survey on 20 October showed that the support for the CDP and other opposition parties was growing steadily against that of the ruling LDP, with 22.6% of the respondents planned to vote for the LDP in the proportional representation block, 14.1% for the CDP, narrowing the gap between the two main parties to 8.5 percentage points from 14.0 points in the last survey. 9.7% of respondents wanted to see the ruling and opposition parties to be evenly split, while 20.5% said they wanted to see the LDP out of power, up 5.4 points from the previous survey.<ref>{{cite news|title=Support for opposition parties grows ahead of upcoming election: poll|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/918deb6ac460-urgent-ishibas-cabinet-approval-rating-at-41-disapproval-at-40-poll.html|work=Kyodo News|date=2024-10-20 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026043453/https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/918deb6ac460-urgent-ishibas-cabinet-approval-rating-at-41-disapproval-at-40-poll.html |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Another poll on 21 October by the Kyodo News suggested the LDP-Komeito coalition might lose its majority, the first time since the 2009 general election, while the CDP could win more than 100 seats in the single-seat districts, up sharply from 60 before the election, and more seats under proportional representation. The Nippon Ishin no Kai was projected to lose some of its 43 seats, while the DPP could increase its seats from seven before the race due to greater support in the proportional representation block, with the JCP building on the nine seats it held.<ref>{{cite news|title=Japan ruling bloc struggling to retain lower house majority: poll|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/cc161ecd3253-japan-ruling-bloc-struggling-to-retain-lower-house-majority-poll.html|date=2024-10-22|work=Kyodo News |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026043715/https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/cc161ecd3253-japan-ruling-bloc-struggling-to-retain-lower-house-majority-poll.html |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 20 October, LDP Secretary-General [[Hiroshi Moriyama]] floated the idea of expanding the coalition framework by "holding discussions with political parties that have the same policies and are committed to developing the country". Although he said that he did not have a specific party in mind, there were "whispers" within the party that the conservative-leaning Ishin and DPP could be new coalition partners.<ref>{{cite news|title=衆院選後も混乱不可避 自公過半数割れの可能性、連立拡大模索か 産経・FNN終盤調査|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241021-VUBH6P5LYFNHRNSJ5KXUHUFUAA/?outputType=theme_election2024|date=2024-10-21|work=産経新聞|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241021142919/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241021-VUBH6P5LYFNHRNSJ5KXUHUFUAA/?outputType=theme_election2024 |archive-date=2024-10-21 |url-status=live}}</ref> Ishin Secretary-General [[Fujita Fumitake]] on 23 October said it was impossible for the time being for his party to form a coalition with the LDP and Komeito if the ruling coalition lost its majority.<ref>{{cite news|title=維新 藤田幹事長 自公との連立 "現時点ではない"|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241023/k10014617501000.html|work=NHK|date=2024-10-23|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026043951/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20241023/k10014617501000.html |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref> He also declined to form a coalition with the CDP given that the LDP and Komeito Party did not have a majority, citing differences in their security, energy, and economic policies.<ref>{{cite news|title=「自公政権相いれない」維新・藤田文武幹事長が連立入り否定 立民との連立も否定的|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241023-UR3SD4KZLZNB5DPQOAU52QGVKM/?outputType=theme_election2024|work=産経新聞|date=2024-10-23|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026044037/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241023-UR3SD4KZLZNB5DPQOAU52QGVKM/?outputType=theme_election2024 |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Election violence==
On the morning of 19 October, Atsunobu Usuda, a 49-year-old man from [[Kawaguchi, Saitama|Kawaguchi]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]], threw firebombs at the LDP headquarters and crashed a van into a barrier at the nearby [[Naikaku Sōri Daijin Kantei|Prime Minister's Office]] in Tokyo. No injury was reported but a police vehicle was partially burned after Usuda threw around five objects at the LDP headquarters. According to his father, Usuda had previously been active in [[Anti-nuclear power movement in Japan|anti-nuclear protests]] and had also expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's electoral system, where candidates are required to deposit hefty sums of money to stand.<ref name="firebombs">{{cite news|title=Man throws firebombs at LDP HQ, crashes van at prime minister's office|date=2024-10-19|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/2c0f25ecac79-urgent-object-thrown-at-japan-ruling-party-hq-police.html|work=Kyodo News|access-date=2024-10-25|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026045137/https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/2c0f25ecac79-urgent-object-thrown-at-japan-ruling-party-hq-police.html |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Speaking during a campaign in [[Satsumasendai]], [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] on the same day, Prime Minister Ishiba said that "democracy must never succumb to violence" and pledged to do "everything possible to ensure that this election is not ruined by violence".<ref>{{cite news|title=石破首相、街頭演説で「選挙が暴力で破壊されないよう万全尽くす」 自民党本部に火炎瓶|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241019-CL7GNTZ7LFMCVGQCDYBDXXQBFY/?outputType=theme_election2024|work=産経新聞|date=2024-10-19|archive-url=https://archive.today/20241026045021/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241019-CL7GNTZ7LFMCVGQCDYBDXXQBFY/?outputType=theme_election2024 |archive-date=26 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Debates==
The LDP slush fund scandal became a major issue during the debate hosted by the [[Japan National Press Club]] on 12 October. CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda criticised Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's dissolution of the Diet as a "cover-up" of the scandal and that "a change of government is the greatest political reform". Ishiba said that he would consider abolishing the policy activity expenses in the future but maintained that "it is legal under the current system" and the party would not use it "restrainedly" when questioned by DPP leader, Yuichiro Tamaki.<ref>{{cite news|title=政策活動費は「衆院選で使わない」石破茂首相が明言 旧安倍派還流の再調査には含み|date=2023-10-13|work=産経新聞|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241013-AW453SRPDJLGTMTNTOZWX63C7Y/?outputType=theme_election2024|archive-date=19 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241219194011/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241013-AW453SRPDJLGTMTNTOZWX63C7Y/?outputType=theme_election2024 |url-status=live}}</ref> Ishin leader Nobuyuki Baba also criticised Komeito's decision to recommend two former LDP lawmakers which were not endorsed by the LDP due to the scandal. Komeito leader, Ishii Keiichi explained that the decision was based on criteria such as "the understanding of local [Komeito] party members and supporters".<ref name="政権担当能力競う">{{cite news|title=首相と立民代表、政権担当能力競う 7党首討論会 核抑止や「石破印」政策でも論戦|work=産経新聞|date=2024-10-12|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-XNANVI35FVLBVPVOWGUDB6I4SU/ |archive-date=19 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241219181224/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-XNANVI35FVLBVPVOWGUDB6I4SU |url-status=live}}</ref>

Several opposition parties called for the reduction or abolition of the consumption tax, with the CDP suggesting a "tax credit with benefits" that would essentially refund part of the consumption tax by combining tax credits and benefits for low- and middle-income earners. Ishiba argued that the country needed a stable source of funding for social security going forward and would not consider lowering the tax.<ref>{{cite news|title=消費税論戦 石破首相「社会保障の安定財源」 野田氏「困っている人に給付付き税額控除」|work=産経新聞|date=2024-10-12|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-KETLLHLHVNKK7D4IW5GDZHMNCM/?outputType=theme_election2024|archive-date=19 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241219180943/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-KETLLHLHVNKK7D4IW5GDZHMNCM/ |url-status=live}}</ref> 

Noda suggested that Japan should participate as an observer in the Conference of the Parties to the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] in order to achieve nuclear abolition, while Ishiba stressed the functionality of [[nuclear deterrence]].<ref name="政権担当能力競う" /> Noda also said he would abolish the unconstitutional parts of the security-related laws if the CDP gained power.<ref>{{cite news|title=「政治とカネ」や経済で7党首が論戦 石破茂首相は日米地位協定改定「必ず実現」|url=https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-AUNXHHZ66JMCZCPKRCDLE3KLLY/?outputType=theme_election2024|date=2024-10-12|work=産経新聞|archive-date=19 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241219175956/https://www.sankei.com/article/20241012-AUNXHHZ66JMCZCPKRCDLE3KLLY/?outputType=theme_election2024 |url-status=live}}</ref> Baba questioned Ishiba's determination and feasibility in reviewing the [[U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement]], a pledge made during the recent LDP leadership race.<ref name="政権担当能力競う" />
