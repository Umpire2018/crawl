[[File:Women reciting Fatiha on Qasem Soleimani's grave 01.jpg|thumb|The grave of Qasem Soleimani at the Martyrs' Cemetery in [[Kerman]], 2021]]

On 3 January 2020, General [[Qasem Soleimani]] was [[Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|killed by a United States drone attack]] in Iraq. Soleimani was the commander of the [[Quds Force]] of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]]. Soleimani held a position of significant influence in Iran, widely considered the second most powerful figure in the country after Supreme Leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]]. As leader of the Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the IRGC, he played a key role in shaping Iranian policy across the region. Soleimani was responsible for overseeing clandestine missions and providing guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and logistical support to allied governments and armed groups, including [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]].<ref name="BBC"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=3 January 2024|title=Iran says at least 73 killed in 'terror' blasts near grave of IRGC general Soleimani|work=Times of Israel|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-january-03-2024/|access-date=3 January 2024|archive-date=3 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240103001122/https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-january-03-2024/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===U.S. warning to Iran===
{{Blockquote|Prior to ISIS' terrorist attack on 3 January 2024, in Kerman, Iran, the US government provided Iran with a private warning that there was a terrorist threat within Iranian borders. The US government followed a longstanding '[[Duty to warn#U.S. Intelligence Community|duty to warn]]' policy that has been implemented across administrations to warn governments against potential lethal threats. We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.|A U.S. official, quoted by [https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-secretly-warned-iran-isis-terror-attack/index.html CNN]}}

The [[United States]] secretly warned [[Iran]] about intelligence that the [[Islamic State]] was planning a potential [[terrorism|terror attack]] inside Iran's borders before the deadly 3 January bombings in Kerman, according to a U.S. official.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bertrand |first1=Natasha |title=US secretly warned Iran before ISIS terror attack |url=https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-secretly-warned-iran-isis-terror-attack/index.html |access-date=26 January 2024 |publisher=CNN |date=25 January 2024}}</ref> The private warning was based on U.S. intelligence about ISIS' plans and was provided to Iran based on the U.S. government's "duty to warn" policy, which applies even to adversaries, to warn about potential lethal threats.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |title=U.S. Secretly Alerted Iran Ahead of Islamic State Terrorist Attacks |url=https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-secretly-alerted-iran-ahead-of-islamic-state-terrorist-attack-af77a19a |work=Wall Street Journal |date=25 January 2024}}</ref>

The warning from the U.S. to Iran is notable not only because Iran is a U.S. adversary, but also because of recent [[Iran and state-sponsored terrorism|Iranian proxy attacks]] on U.S. personnel in the Middle East.<ref name="wsj" /> However, the U.S. official stated the warning was provided "in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks."<ref name="wsj"/>

Despite the U.S. warning, Iran was ultimately unable to stop the 3 January ISIS attack, which killed at least 84 people and was the deadliest such incident in the country since the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979.<ref name="cnnisis" />

According to the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], the "duty to warn" policy requires the U.S. intelligence community to warn intended victims, including non-U.S. persons, about "credible and specific" threats of intentional killing, serious injury or kidnapping.<ref name="wsj"/>

==Suspect arrested==

The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence has announced the detention of a key figure believed to be behind the deadly terrorist bombings that struck the city of Kerman earlier this year.

In a statement released on July 13, 2024, the ministry said it had apprehended "one of the ring leaders and main plotters" of the attacks, identifying him as Abdullah Quetta.

According to the statement, the intelligence obtained from Quetta has played a "significant role" in uncovering "many Takfiri conspiracies" and identifying other major elements involved in the plot.
