=== Misinformation ===
According to ''[[Tagesschau (German TV programme)|Tagesschau]]'', following the attack, various domestic and foreign actors started spreading false information on social media. They said that before the first official statement by authorities was made, Austrian far-right activist [[Martin Sellner]] said that the alleged perpetrator was Syrian. They said that other&nbsp;sources said that the perpetrator had come to Germany as a Syrian refugee during the [[2015 European migrant crisis]]. They said that Sellner and other activists greatly exaggerated the number of victims and said that there were 5 perpetrators of the attack instead of 1 and that 11 people were killed instead of 2. They said that sources distributed video footage of Syrians celebrating the [[Fall of the Assad regime|overthrow of the Assad regime]] in Germany and said that they showed Syrians celebrating the attack. Federal President [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] was accused of saying a quote: "one should not expose the person who committed the crime ... but listen to the reasons calmly and patiently"; Tagesschau said it was later established that he never said it. They said Anti-Israel activists spread false reports that the attack was a false flag operation carried out by the [[Mossad]] to boost Western support for Israel. They also said Turkish nationalists claimed that Kurdish militias carried out the attack in retaliation for Germany's alleged support for Turkey in the [[Syrian civil war]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 23, 2024 |title=Rechtsextreme Desinformation über Anschlag |trans-title=Right-wing extremist disinformation about attack |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/magdeburg-anschlag-102.html |website=dw.com |access-date=23 December 2024 |archive-date=23 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241223195825/https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/magdeburg-anschlag-102.html |url-status=live |language=de}}</ref> 

According to ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', on social media, various accounts said that suspect behind the attack was shouting "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" as he was being arrested by police.

=== Protests ===
Anti-migration protests were organized by the [[Far-right politics in Germany (1945–present)|far-right]] at the site of the attack. Protesters carried signs calling for [[remigration]] and shouted slogans such as [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|"Wir sind das Volk"]] (German: "We are the People").

== Investigation ==
According to Germany's head of domestic security agency [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]], [[Holger Münch]], the authorities have yet to determine a motive. The federal prosecutors would take up the case if the killings were deemed to be acts of terrorism caused by an attacker motivated by political or religious convictions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 December 2024 |title=Germany Tries to Untangle Complex Profile of Market Attack Suspect |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-attack.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=23 December 2024 |archive-date=22 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241222165652/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-attack.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Münch stated that prior to the attack, police received a tip from Saudi Arabian authorities about a tweet in which Taleb threatened Germany would pay a "price" for its treatment of Saudi refugees. The police in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], the capital of [[Magdeburg]] started looking into it, and "proceedings were initiated" according to Münch, but he also added that the threats were too unspecific. Münch stated that the actions of the suspect appeared to follow "a completely atypical pattern".<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gadzo |first=Mersiha |date=22 December 2024 |title=German Christmas market attack suspect to face murder charges |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/german-christmas-market-attack-suspect-to-face-murder-charges |access-date=2024-12-24 |work=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref> 

On 21 December, the suspect behind the attack was brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on five counts of [[murder]], multiple counts of [[attempted murder]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].

== Criticism of security at the market ==
In view of the increased security precautions at German Christmas markets following the [[2016 Berlin truck attack|attack in Berlin in 2016]] – including concrete and steel roadblocks – terrorism experts criticized shortcomings in Magdeburg's security concept, according to which it should be impossible for vehicles to enter areas with crowds of people.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-20 |title=Anschlag in Magdeburg: Experte verwundert über Sicherheit |trans-title=Magdeburg attack: expert surprised about safety |url=https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/madgdeburg-anschlag-weihnachtsmarkt-terror-experte-100.html |access-date=2025-01-01 |website=ZDFheute |language=de}}</ref> The organizers had left an escape route for emergency service vehicles open, through which the perpetrator drove past all the blockades into the market.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-21 |title=Täter nahm Fluchtweg auf den Weihnachtsmarkt – Hat das Sicherheitskonzept versagt? |trans-title=Perpetrator took escape route on Christmas market – has the safety concept failed? |url=https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/deutschland/innenpolitik/id_100558026/magdeburg-hat-das-sicherheitskonzept-versagt-verdaechtiger-nutzte-fluchtweg.html |access-date=2025-01-01 |website=t-online |language=de}}</ref> Professor of Security Studies [[Peter R.

The Ministry of the Interior of Saxony-Anhalt confirmed that a police vehicle intended to act as a mobile barrier, was parked 30 meters away. A chain to block the gap between two concrete blocks, required by the security plan, was absent.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bredow |first=Birte |last2=Großekemper |first2=Tobias |last3=Maxwill |first3=Peter |date=2024-12-27 |title=Wie schaffte es Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, auf den Magdeburger Weihnachtsmarkt zu rasen? |trans-title=How did Taleb Al Abdulmohsen manage to rush into the Magdeburg Christmas market? |url=https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/anschlag-in-magdeburg-wieso-konnte-taleb-al-abdulmohsen-auf-den-weihnachtsmarkt-rasen-a-77ed3ffa-b6f0-47ec-80a2-65ef09fbce52 |access-date=2025-01-01 |work=Der Spiegel |issn=2195-1349 |url-access=subscription |language=de}}</ref> According to research by ''[[Die Welt]]'', the concept for the practical use of this barrier made no provision for responsibility or personnel.
