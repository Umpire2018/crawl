Parliamentary elections were held in [[Madagascar]] on 29 May 2024 to elect the 163 members of the [[National Assembly (Madagascar)|National Assembly]]. The election took place a few months after [[Andry Rajoelina]] was re-elected in the [[2023 Malagasy presidential election| November 2023 presidential elections]], which were marked by low turnout and an opposition boycott.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-16 |title=Présidentielle à Madagascar: les premières estimations confirment la faible participation |url=https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20231116-pr%C3%A9sidentielle-%C3%A0-madagascar-les-premi%C3%A8res-estimations-confirment-la-faible-participation |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=RFI |language=fr}}</ref>

The ruling [[Young Malagasies Determined]], in coalition with Together with President Andry Rajoelina (IRMAR), remained the largest bloc in the National Assembly. According to preliminary results, the coalition initially lost its majority. However, after appeals to the High Constitutional Court, the coalition regained four previously lost seats, securing 84 seats, which allowed it to maintain its majority in the new legislature.

The opposition coalition {{ill|Firaisankina|fr}}, led by [[Marc Ravalomanana]], won 22 seats, an increase of six compared to the previous election. Smaller parties including [[Fiovana Ivoaran'ny eny Ifotony|FIVOI]] and [[Kôlektifa an'ny Malagasy|Kôlektifa]] also secured seats, while independent candidates made a strong showing, winning 50 seats.
