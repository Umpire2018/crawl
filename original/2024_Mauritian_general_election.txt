=== 2020 oil spill and protests ===
{{see also|MV Wakashio oil spill|2020 Mauritian protests}}
In July 2020, a Japanese-controlled bulk carrier, ''Wakashio'', crashed into a coral reef off the coast of south-eastern Mauritius, near [[Mahébourg]], resulting in an oil spill. The Jugnauth government declared a national emergency on 7 August. The incident, which occurred near two environmentally protected marine ecosystems,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Singh Khadka |first1=Navin |title=Why the Mauritius oil spill is so serious |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53754751 |access-date=23 November 2024 |work=[[BBC]] |date=13 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240919103258/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53754751 |archive-date=19 September 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> resulted in a setback for the tourism and fisheries sectors, on which Mauritius is highly dependent. The environmental damage and the death of wildlife sparked public outcry, and the government response faced criticism for a perceived failure to hold foreign actors accountable. As a result, protests broke out, a rare occurrence in Mauritius that saw an attendance of around 100,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Degnarain |first1=Nishan |title=Mauritius Sees Popular Protests Over Handling Of The Wakashio Oil Spill And Whale Deaths |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/08/29/mauritius-sees-popular-protests-over-handling-of-the-wakashio-oil-spill-and-whale-deaths/ |access-date=23 November 2024 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=29 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830153910/https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/08/29/mauritius-sees-popular-protests-over-handling-of-the-wakashio-oil-spill-and-whale-deaths/#cf5c0d352531 |archive-date=30 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Wire-tapping scandal ===
{{Main|2024 Mauritian social media ban}}
In October 2024, a wire-tapping scandal broke out; the phone calls of numerous journalists, politicians, civil society members and foreign diplomats were reportedly tapped and leaked on the internet. Prime Minister Jugnauth and the Mauritius Police Force claimed that artificial intelligence had modified the leaked calls. Journalists affected by the tapping, however, said the calls were authentic. One journalist alleged the government's AI claims were an attempt to deflect attention from the scandal's fallout.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scandal Erupts in Mauritius as Wire-Tapping Allegations Emerge |url=https://newsmoris.com/2024/10/27/scandal-erupts-in-mauritius-as-wire-tapping-allegations-emerge/ |access-date=3 November 2024 |work=News Moris |date=27 October 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241103231759/https://newsmoris.com/2024/10/27/scandal-erupts-in-mauritius-as-wire-tapping-allegations-emerge/ |archive-date=3 November 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jugnauth announced an emergency committee would investigate the breach. Citing national security concerns, the government implemented a social media ban on 1 November, to last until the day after the election. Four suspects, including a former CEO of [[Mauritius Telecom]], were arrested that day. The opposition claimed the ban was politically motivated and aimed at preventing the Jugnauth government's defeat at the polls.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mauritius blocks social media until after election amid wiretapping row |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/mauritius-blocks-social-media-until-after-election-amid-wiretapping-row |access-date=3 November 2024 |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=1 November 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241103232317/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/mauritius-blocks-social-media-until-after-election-amid-wiretapping-row |archive-date=3 November 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> Following widespread public uproar, the government reversed the ban on 2 November.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kloren |first1=Sarene |title=Mauritius lifts social media ban following outcry from civil rights groups |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/mauritius-lifts-social-media-ban-following-outcry-from-civil-rights-groups-c05d5a97-175a-4c2d-8237-0aec6e0fb41e |access-date=3 November 2024 |work=[[Independent Online]] |date=2 November 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241103232649/https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/mauritius-lifts-social-media-ban-following-outcry-from-civil-rights-groups-c05d5a97-175a-4c2d-8237-0aec6e0fb41e |archive-date=3 November 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Campaign ==
Major issues among voters included the cost of living crisis, corruption and crime. Many Mauritians called for government-sponsored rehabilitation and education to combat the rising rates of drug use in the country. A July 2024 [[Afrobarometer]] survey showed that Mauritians considered drug addiction and abuse to be the second-most important issue after the cost of living.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lawal |first1=Shola |title=Mauritius election 2024: Amid wiretapping scandal, what's at stake? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/10/mauritius-election-amid-wiretapping-scandal-whats-at-stake |access-date=10 November 2024 |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=10 November 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241110193158/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/10/mauritius-election-amid-wiretapping-scandal-whats-at-stake |archive-date=10 November 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alliance Lepep announced a manifesto on 28 October. The alliance emphasised a commitment to economic reform and social welfare. The bloc proposals included a monthly allowance of 2000 [[Mauritian rupee|rupees]] for stay-at-home mothers, the establishment of a fund to assist students from low-income families, and a special tribunal to expedite criminal drug cases. In light of the wire-tapping scandal, the bloc promised the creation of an independent body that would combat phone-tapping.<ref>{{cite news |title=Présentation du programme électoral de l'Alliance Lepep |url=https://www.lemauricien.com/actualites/politique/live-presentation-du-programme-electoral-de-lalliance-lepep/654396/ |access-date=9 November 2024 |work=[[Le Mauricien]] |date=23 October 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241109033545/https://www.lemauricien.com/actualites/politique/live-presentation-du-programme-electoral-de-lalliance-lepep/654396/ |archive-date=9 November 2024|url-status=live |language=fr}}</ref> Other initiatives included free prescription medicine and signing a final treaty with the UK to seal the Chagos Islands agreement.<ref name=chagos1/> It also pledged to finance economic programs using payments made to be made by the UK under the revised agreement over the Chagos Islands.<ref name=AJ1>{{cite news |title=Mauritius holds parliamentary election with cost of living crisis key issue |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/10/mauritius-holds-parliamentary-election-with-cost-of-living-crisis-key-issue |access-date=10 November 2024 |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=10 November 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241110212139/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/10/mauritius-holds-parliamentary-election-with-cost-of-living-crisis-key-issue |archive-date=10 November 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alliance du Changement launched a manifesto on 29 October. Proposals included tax exemptions for citizens aged 18 to 28, measures to end fuel shortages, the introduction of a green economy and free public transport.
