In March 2022, following [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine]], Moldova submitted an application for EU membership.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moldova officially applies for EU membership |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/moldova-officially-applies-for-eu-membership |access-date=2024-03-26 |date=2022-03-03 |website=Al Jazeera}}</ref> That June Moldova was granted the status of a candidate country by the [[European Council]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-23 |title=EU leaders grant Ukraine and Moldova candidate status |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-grant-ukraine-and-moldova-candidate-status/ |access-date=2024-03-26 |website=[[Politico]]}}</ref> In December 2023, the European Council announced its decision to open accession negotiations with Moldova.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-17 |title=European Council decides to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, grants candidate status to Georgia |url=https://eufordigital.eu/european-council-decides-to-open-accession-negotiations-with-ukraine-and-moldova-grants-candidate-status-to-georgia/ |access-date=2024-03-26 |website=EU4Digital}}</ref> Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU accession.<ref>{{cite web |work=romania-insider.com |first=Iulian |last=Ernst |date=22 May 2023 |title=Moldova sets 2030 as EU accession target at massive pro-EU rally in Chisinau |url=https://www.romania-insider.com/moldova-rally-eu-accession-may-2023}}</ref>

On 21 March 2024, the [[Parliament of Moldova]] endorsed a resolution of 54-to-0 to continue the efforts to join the European Union.

The leader of Gagauzia, [[Evghenia Guțul]], also expressed support for the movement, which revolves around Șor Party leader, oligarch, and convicted fraudster and money launderer [[Ilan Shor]]. Moldovan Infrastructure Minister [[Andrei Spînu]] called the members of the coalition "traitors" and suggested that it had been formed "right next to the Kremlin".<ref>{{cite web |first=Alexander |last=Tanas |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldovan-opposition-announces-new-election-bloc-moscow-event-2024-04-21/ |title=Moldovan opposition announces new election bloc at Moscow event |date=21 April 2024 |access-date=22 April 2024 |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Analysts said ballots from the largely pro-EU [[Moldovan diaspora|diaspora]] were counted towards the end, giving the "yes" campaign a last-moment push.<ref name=":32"/><ref name="bbc diaspora"/> The "yes" option was selected by 45.38% of voters living in Moldova and 76.96% of Moldovan citizens living or being placed abroad.

=== Instances of vote buying ===
President Sandu attributed the close result of the referendum to foreign interference and described it as an "unprecedented assault on democracy", adding that her government had evidence that 150,000 votes had been bought, with a goal by criminal entities of 300,000 votes.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Vincenzo |last=Genovese |access-date=27 October 2024 |date=21 October 2024 |title=Moldova president alleges vote-buying tainted EU referendum results |url=https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/21/moldovas-president-alleges-vote-buying-tainted-eu-referendum-results |website=euronews}}</ref> The European Union also said that the two exercises had taken place "under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies".<ref name="bbc-202410212">{{Cite web |last1=Rainsford |first1=Sarah |last2=Gozzi |first2=Laura |date=21 October 2024 |title=Moldova says 'Yes' to pro-EU constitutional changes by tiny margin |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wnr5qdxe7o |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=BBC News}}</ref>

Earlier in the year, an investigation conducted by the newspaper ''[[Ziarul de Gardă]]'' revealed the existence of a criminal enterprise headed by [[Ilan Shor]], which received $15&nbsp;million from the Russian government (the admissions were recorded on camera); those funds were then distributed to around 130,000 people in order to bribe voters and spread disinformation against the [[European Union]].<ref name="Moldova uncovers"/><ref name="Vote Rigging"/> Russia denied the accusations.<ref name="kremlin denies2">{{Cite web |date=13 October 2024 |title=Kremlin Denies Meddling in Moldova's Elections |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/10/14/kremlin-denies-meddling-in-moldovas-upcoming-election-a86678 |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=The Moscow Times}}</ref><ref name="radio svoboda-202410212">{{Cite news |last=Vagner |first=Aleksandra |date=21 October 2024 |title=50 на 50.

Four hundred Moldovan citizens were investigated for allegedly receiving money to choose the "no" option in the referendum and vote for a determined candidate in the presidential election.

The head of the [[Moldovan Police]], Viorel Cernăuțeanu, stated on 24 October that since September, a total of $39&nbsp;million, including 15&nbsp;million that month and 24&nbsp;million in October, had been transferred to over 138,000 people in Moldova through the Russian bank [[Promsvyazbank]], which is banned in Moldova. He added that the number of people that had benefited from this system would be much greater as they would have received money not only for themselves but also for members of their family. This money transfer system was believed to have started in late spring, and was carried out through applications that people downloaded with instructions from interactive chatbots on [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]]. This allowed them to enter the system and benefit from transfers from the bank. Cernăuțeanu stated that Moldovan police had documented and stopped the activity of such bots in 97 Telegram groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newsmaker.md/ro/transferuri-de-peste-39-mln-pentru-a-corupe-masiv-electoratul-igp-circa-138-mii-de-persoane-din-moldova-in-contact-cu-psb-bank/|title=Transferuri de până la $39 mln pentru a "corupe masiv electoratul".

A later national poll showed that 74.7% of respondents knew people who had received benefits, material or financial, for their vote.

The European Union welcomed the results and condemned the alleged "unprecedented malign interference by Russia".<ref name="auto"/> European Commission President [[Ursula von der Leyen]] praised the referendum result, saying that "In the face of Russia's hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!", while the United States also noted Russian attempts to "undermine Moldova's election and its European integration".<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGrath |first=Stephen |date=21 October 2024 |title=Moldova narrowly votes to secure path toward EU membership after accusing Russia of interference |url=https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-eu-referendum-russia-325cb2c13beb1d76565a6e2aadef971a |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=[[Associated Press]] }}</ref> Meanwhile, the Kremlin expressed doubt on how the 'Yes' vote narrowly won and reiterated its denial of allegations of interference.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 October 2024 |title=Kremlin Says Moldova's Election Results 'Raise Questions,' Denies Meddling Claims |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/10/21/kremlin-says-moldovas-election-results-raise-questions-denies-meddling-claims-a86757 |access-date=21 October 2024 |website=The Moscow Times}}</ref>

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] observer team said in a statement that the constitutional referendum was well-managed and contestants campaigned freely in an environment characterized by concerns of illicit foreign interference and active disinformation efforts. While this affected the integrity of the process, campaign conditions did not allow for a level playing field among contestants, as the media coverage favoured the incumbent and the government and there was misuse of public resources. OSCE stated that "the election administration worked professionally and demonstrated impartiality in their decision-making", and special co-ordinator [[Lucie Potůčková]] praised the country "for implementing a number of reforms to increase public confidence in the electoral system, in the context of heavy Russian propaganda. From implementing cybersecurity measures to ensuring a high degree of women's participation, there is much to celebrate in this election".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moldova's election and referendum well-managed and competitive, despite serious attempts to undermine its integrity, international observers say |url=https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/578845 |access-date=2024-10-22 |website=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] |date=21 October 2024 }}</ref>

Former foreign minister [[Nicu Popescu]] praised the victory of the "yes" side and said that "even a marginal victory is still a victory", in the context of the narrow result in favour of EU integration.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-21 |title=Reacție în tabara Maiei Sandu, după rezultatul pe muchie de cuţit la referendumul din Republica Moldova: 'O victorie la limită este tot o victorie' |website=HotNews.ro |url=https://hotnews.ro/reactie-in-tabara-maiei-sandu-dupa-rezultatul-pe-muchie-de-cutit-la-referendumul-din-republica-moldova-o-victorie-la-limita-este-tot-o-victorie-1817806 |trans-title=Reaction in Maiei Sandu's camp, after the close result in the referendum in Moldova: 'A narrow victory is still a victory' |access-date=2024-10-22 |language=ro}}</ref>

In a statement on 24 October, Sandu stated that, despite the instances of vote buying, she had rejected suggestions of annulling and repeating the elections as "no one has the right to deny citizens a massive, honest and free expression of their will". She further stated that, without the buying of votes, "we would have had a clear victory for both the presidential elections and the referendum", and also urged the Moldovan judiciary to "wake up" and address the issue of electoral bribery.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/international/de-ce-nu-au-fost-anulate-alegerile-din-republica-moldova-in-ciuda-fraudelor-masive-explicatiile-oferite-de-maia-sandu.html |title=De ce nu au fost anulate alegerile din Republica Moldova, în ciuda fraudelor masive.
