In the [[2020 Mongolian parliamentary election|2020 parliamentary elections]] the [[Mongolian People's Party]] won a supermajority of 62 of the 76 seats and formed a government.

===Redistricting===
On 18 December 2023, the ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus to redraw the electoral districts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=B. |first1=Manlai |title=The MPP has decided to conduct the 2024 parliamentary elections in large regionalized constituencies |url=https://ikon.mn/n/316e |website=ikon |date=18 December 2023 |archive-date=24 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224233249/https://ikon.mn/n/316e |url-status=live }}</ref> Subsequently, the State Great Khural's plenary session passed a resolution on the creation of 2024 regular election constituencies of the State Great Khural, and the determination of the number, territory of the mandates of the constituencies, resulting in the reformation of the electoral districts.

==Electoral system==
{{see also|Elections in Mongolia}}

Following the passing of a new electoral law, the elections were held using a [[Parallel voting|parallel system]], with 78 seats elected by [[multiple non-transferable vote]] in 13 multi-member constituencies and 48 by [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] at the national level with an electoral threshold of 4% for individual parties, 5% for a two-party coalition and 7% for coalitions of three or more parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=Some new regulations on parliamentary elections|url=https://montsame.mn/mn/read/321621|work=montsame|date=16 March 2014|access-date=20 June 2023|archive-date=20 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230620094235/https://montsame.mn/mn/read/321621|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Marissa |title=Parliamentary Elections 2024: Yet Another New Election System |url=https://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2024/yet-another-new-election-system/ |access-date=2024-04-19 |website=Mongolia Focus |publisher=University of British Columbia |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406103449/https://blogs.ubc.ca/mongolia/2024/yet-another-new-election-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref> To qualify for proportional seats, parties and coalitions must also have candidates running in at least half of the seats in each constituency.
