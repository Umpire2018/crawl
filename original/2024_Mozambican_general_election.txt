General elections were held in [[Mozambique]] on 9 October 2024 to elect the [[List of presidents of Mozambique|president]], the 250 members of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Mozambique)|Assembly of the Republic]] and members of the ten provincial assemblies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mozambique to Hold Presidential Election Oct. 9 Next Year|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-04/mozambique-to-hold-presidential-election-oct-9-next-year|website=Bloomberg|date=4 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=7 August 2023 |title=Mozambique to Hold General Elections On October 9, Next Year • 360 Mozambique |url=https://360mozambique.com/development/mozambique-to-hold-presidential-election-on-october-9-next-year/ |access-date=12 September 2023 |website=360 Mozambique |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mozambique: Presidential, legislative elections scheduled for 9 October 2024 |url=https://clubofmozambique.com/news/mozambique-presidential-legislative-elections-scheduled-for-9-october-2024-242721/ |access-date=12 September 2023 |website=Mozambique |language=en-US}}</ref>

The ruling [[FRELIMO]] party, which has increasingly become marked with growing concerns of authoritarianism and impunity amid the controversies surrounding the [[2023 Mozambican local elections|2023 local elections]] and the [[2019 Mozambican general election|2019 general election]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Mozambique: October 9 |url=https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/mozambique/ |website=Africa Center for Strategic Studies |access-date=1 April 2024}}</ref> was declared the winner of the election, with its leader, [[Daniel Chapo]], proclaimed as [[President of Mozambique|president-elect]]. This was disputed by [[Venâncio Mondlane]], with his party [[Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique|PODEMOS]] claiming Mondlane had received 53% of the vote using data from their poll observers. The result was also questioned by the [[Episcopal Conference of Mozambique]] and the [[European Union]], while [[2024–2025 Mozambican protests|deadly protests broke out over the election results]], with at least 250 deaths, mostly demonstrators being killed by police and army forces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mozambique top court confirms ruling party's win in disputed election |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/23/mozambique-top-court-confirms-ruling-partys-win-in-disputed-election |website=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=23 December 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mozambique post-election violence kills 125 in three days: NGO |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241226-mozambique-post-election-violence-kills-125-in-three-days-ngo |website=[[France 24]] |access-date=27 December 2024}}</ref> 

==Background==
FRELIMO, which has ruled the country since 1975 when they created a [[People's Republic of Mozambique|one-party Marxist–Leninist state]], allowed multi-party elections as part of the peace process that ended the [[Mozambican Civil War]] in [[1994 Mozambican general election|1994]]; however, the opposition has decried these elections as rigged in FRELIMO's favor. After the [[2023 Mozambican local elections|2023 local elections]] protests broke out due to alleged fraud on the part of FRELIMO with the police killing at least three protesters. Public perceptions of the election were muted, as many view a FRELIMO victory as a foregone conclusion.<ref name="Reuters 10-9" />

==Electoral system==
The [[List of presidents of Mozambique|president]] is elected using the [[two-round system]].<ref>[http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2327/ Republic of Mozambique: Election for President (President)] IFES</ref> The 250 members of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Mozambique)|Assembly of the Republic]] are elected by [[proportional representation]] in eleven multi-member constituencies based on the country's [[provinces of Mozambique|provinces]] and on a first-past-the-post basis from two single-member constituencies representing Mozambican citizens in Africa and Europe. Seats in the multi-member constituencies are allocated using the [[d'Hondt method]], with an [[electoral threshold]] of 5%.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2223_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref> Official results are announced by the National Election Commission (CNE) after 15 days and must subsequently be validated by the Constitutional Council.<ref name="africa"/>

Concerns have been raised over discrepancies in the total number of registered voters, which stands at more than 17 million.<ref>{{cite web |title='We will win!': Mozambique's ruling party confident at final vote rally |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241006-we-will-win-mozambique-s-ruling-party-confident-at-final-vote-rally |website=France 24 |date=7 October 2024 |access-date=7 October 2024}}</ref> The non-governmental organisation Centro de Integridade Pública, citing data published by the CNE, said that there are 878,868 more registered voters than there are voting age adults in some provinces, leading them to describe 5% of the electorate as "ghost voters". The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also notes the existence of "ghost voters" in seven of the country's ten provinces, with up to a third of the registered voting population in [[Gaza Province]] believed to be non-existent.<ref name="bbc"/>
