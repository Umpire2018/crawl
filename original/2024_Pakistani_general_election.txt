==Background==
===2018 elections===
{{further|2018 Pakistani general election}}
General elections were held in [[Pakistan]] on 25 July 2018 after the completion of a five-year term by the outgoing government. At the national level, elections were held in [[List of constituencies of Pakistan|272 constituencies]], each electing one member to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies (MPA).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chaudhry |first1=Fahad |title=PTI largest party with 115 NA seats as ECP releases final tally two days after polls |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1423442 |access-date=15 February 2024 |work=dawn.com |date=28 July 2018 |language=en |archive-date=30 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230930162808/https://www.dawn.com/news/1423442 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As a result of the elections, the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI) became the single largest party at the national level in terms of both popular vote and seats. At the provincial level, the PTI remained the largest party in [[2018 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial election|Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KP); the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP) remained the largest party in [[2018 Sindh provincial election|Sindh]] and the newly-formed [[Balochistan Awami Party]] (BAP) became the largest party in [[2018 Balochistan provincial election|Balochistan]]. In [[2018 Punjab provincial election|Punjab]], a hung parliament prevailed with [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N) emerging as the largest party in terms of directly elected seats by a narrow margin.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election vote count: PTI poised to form government with 115 seats so far |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1423240 |access-date=15 February 2024 |work=dawn.com |date=27 July 2018 |language=en |archive-date=5 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705103358/https://www.dawn.com/news/1423240 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, following the support of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] and the joining of [[Independent (politician)|independent]] MPAs into the PTI, the latter became the largest party and was able to form the government.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Malik |first1=Mansoor |title=Buzdar wins race against Hamza for Punjab CM |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1428059 |access-date=15 February 2024 |work=dawn.com |date=20 August 2018 |language=en |archive-date=13 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713212634/https://www.dawn.com/news/1428059 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In January 2023, in a bid to force early general elections, the PTI prematurely dissolved the provincial assemblies it was in power in – namely [[2018 Punjab provincial election|Punjab]] and [[2018 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial election|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]].

=== PTI de facto ban through intra-party election verdict ===
{{main|PTI intra-party elections case}}
On 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party elections to the commission's satisfaction. Subsequently, on the same day, the PTI appealed to the [[Peshawar High Court]] (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision. Consequently, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP submitted a review application to the PHC. In the following days, a two-member bench lifted the suspension order while hearing the case. However, on 10 January 2024, the two-member bench deemed the ECP's order "illegal, without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect." Responding to this, on 11 January, the ECP contested the ruling in the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hakeem |first=Abdul |date=2024-01-10 |title=PTI wins back 'bat' as PHC declares ECP order 'illegal' |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1804672 |access-date=2024-02-05 |website=dawn.com |language=en |archive-date=6 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240206000033/https://www.dawn.com/news/1804672 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 13 January, a three-member panel of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice [[Qazi Faez Isa]], sided with the ECP, reinstating their initial decision to deny the PTI its [[Electoral symbol|election symbol]], the [[cricket bat]], due to the party's failure to conduct intra-party elections by its constitution.

All three trials were held behind closed doors in [[Adiala Jail]], where Khan has been incarcerated since August 2023 on corruption charges, and were marked with rushed proceedings, sudden replacement of defendant's lawyers with state consuls, and other procedural irregularities that led his party to term the decisions to be coming from "[[kangaroo court]]s".<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-01-31 |title=Imran Khan: Former Pakistan PM and wife Bushra Bibi jailed for corruption |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68150959 |access-date=2024-02-06 |language=en-GB |archive-date=31 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240131055111/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68150959 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=30 January 2024 |title=PTI vehemently rejects 'kangaroo court's judgement' |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/01/30/pti-vehemently-rejects-kangaroo-courts-judgement/ |website=Pakistan Today}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ahmad |first=Zulfiqar |date=2024-02-04 |title=Iddat case: PTI strongly reacts to verdict |url=https://www.brecorder.com/news/40287243 |access-date=2024-02-06 |website=Business Recorder |language=en |archive-date=6 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240206015745/https://www.brecorder.com/news/40287243 |url-status=live }}</ref> Khan's sentencing in the marriage case was decried by lawyers and members of the civil society as an overreach and a blow to women's rights.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-03 |title=Iddat case: Lawyers, civil society denounce 'intellectual bankruptcy' following Imran, Bushra's conviction |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1810921 |access-date=2024-02-06 |website=dawn.com |language=en |archive-date=6 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240206023402/https://www.dawn.com/news/1810921 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=4 February 2024 |title=Controversial verdict of Imran's marriage case crosses all limits: Farhatullah Babar |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/02/04/controversial-verdict-of-imrans-marriage-case-crosses-all-limits-farhatullah-babar/ |website=Pakistan Today}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-02-04 |title=Feminists and lawyers lash out at Pakistan judge for hurting woman's dignity in 'un-Islamic' marriage case verdict against Imran and wife |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/feminists-and-lawyers-criticize-pakistan-judge-for-violating-settled-law-in-unislamic-marriage-case/articleshow/107400858.cms |access-date=2024-02-06 |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257 |archive-date=6 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240206015744/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/feminists-and-lawyers-criticize-pakistan-judge-for-violating-settled-law-in-unislamic-marriage-case/articleshow/107400858.cms |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, some observers termed the sentencings as a continuation of the Pakistani military's engineering to keep Khan out of power in the upcoming elections.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Imran Khan is convicted.

===Allegations of pre-poll rigging===
Some observers, including the [[United Nations]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have pointed to what appears to be pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the upcoming elections. There have been notable actions against the PTI and its leaders, including snatching of nomination papers, arbitrary arrests of candidates and their supporters, systematic rejection of nomination papers, and disruption of campaign events. This situation has led to widespread allegations of 'election engineering' and manipulative practices that could potentially favour certain political groups, casting doubts over the fairness of the electoral process.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-06 |title=UN 'Disturbed' Over Pakistan's Clampdown on Ex-PM Khan's Party Ahead of Elections |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/un-disturbed-over-pakistan-s-clampdown-on-ex-pm-khan-party-ahead-of-elections/7476779.html |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Voice of America |language=en |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207111254/https://www.voanews.com/a/un-disturbed-over-pakistan-s-clampdown-on-ex-pm-khan-party-ahead-of-elections/7476779.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="time" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-01 |title=HRCP expresses concern over lack of level playing field in run-up to Feb 8 polls |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1802387 |access-date=2024-01-26 |website=dawn.com |language=en |archive-date=26 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240126092847/https://www.dawn.com/news/1802387 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hussain |first=Abid |title='Election engineering': Is Pakistan's February vote already rigged? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/election-engineering-is-pakistans-february-vote-already-rigged |access-date=2024-01-26 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en |archive-date=15 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240115101202/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/election-engineering-is-pakistans-february-vote-already-rigged |url-status=live }}</ref> Pakistan's electoral commission was also accused of [[gerrymandering]] in favour of the PML-N during the redrawing of voter maps before the elections, with a record 1,300 complaints made.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Baloch |first1=Shah Meer |last2=Ellis-Petersen |first2=Hannah |date=2023-11-29 |title=Pakistan election commission accused of changing voting map to favour ex-PM |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/pakistan-election-commission-accused-of-changing-voting-map-to-favour-ex-pm |access-date=2024-02-07 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207215536/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/pakistan-election-commission-accused-of-changing-voting-map-to-favour-ex-pm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Many candidates affiliated with the PTI complained that following the ban on the usage of the cricket bat as the party's logo for the ballots, the electoral commission provided them with symbols carrying obscure meanings and sometimes awkward connotations such as a calculator, an electric heater, a dice, a bed, an eggplant, which is deemed anatomically suggestive, and a bottle, which carries suggestions of alcohol consumption in the majority-Muslim country.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 February 2024 |title=Eggplants, Bottles, Beds: Pakistan Politicians Reclaim Election Symbols |url=https://www.barrons.com/news/eggplants-bottles-beds-pakistan-politicians-reclaim-election-symbols-4affd324 |access-date=3 February 2024 |website=Barron's |language=en |archive-date=2 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202095614/https://www.barrons.com/news/eggplants-bottles-beds-pakistan-politicians-reclaim-election-symbols-4affd324 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="bbccount"/> This forces some of them to highlight their assigned symbols to voters, particularly those living in rural areas, on [[TikTok]].<ref name="washingtonpost/14feb24" />

The 336 members of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] consist of 266 general seats elected by [[first-past-the-post voting]] in single-member constituencies,<ref>[https://www.geo.tv/latest/420081-ecp-decrease-na-seats-to-336-after-preliminary-delimitation ECP decreases NA seats to 336 in the preliminary delimitation of constituencies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230716024632/https://www.geo.tv/latest/420081-ecp-decrease-na-seats-to-336-after-preliminary-delimitation |date=16 July 2023}} GEO TV, 31 May 2022</ref> 60 seats that are reserved for women elected by [[proportional representation]] based on the number of general seats won by each party in each province, and ten seats that are reserved for non-Muslims elected through proportional representation based on the number of overall general seats won by each party.

The [[Government of Pakistan|government]] had passed a bill that required the next general elections to be held using [[electronic voting|EVMs]] (electronic voting machines). This was aimed at ending the allegations of rigging that have plagued previous elections in Pakistan. Still, the opposition's opinion was that it would make it extremely easy for PTI to rig the elections in their favour through security loopholes.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-25|title=PM vows to defeat the 'corrupt'|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/2296678/2023-general-elections-will-be-free-and-fair-pledges-pm-imran|access-date=2021-04-27|website=The Express Tribune|language=en|archive-date=25 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625065558/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2296678/2023-general-elections-will-be-free-and-fair-pledges-pm-imran|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2022 when the PTI-led government was ousted through a successful [[vote of no-confidence]] in the National Assembly, the 11 opposition parties, some of them being long-time rivals, formed a new government and passed the Elections Amendment Bill, which nullified the use of EVMs in the next general elections. Hence, EVMs were not used in the current general elections. Instead [[ballot|paper ballots]] were once again employed during the elections. Furthermore, [[Pakistani diaspora|overseas Pakistanis]] were also prevented from [[Electronic voting|e-voting]] in these elections because of this amendment.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-26 |title=NA amends election laws to stop EVMs use |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2358414/na-amends-election-laws-to-stop-evms-use |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en |archive-date=12 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230812003612/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2358414/na-amends-election-laws-to-stop-evms-use |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Voting and transmission of results===
{{Further|Election Commission of Pakistan general election forms}}
Registered voters in each [[polling station]] of an electoral district get two paper ballots to put a stamp on their preferred candidate for the national and provincial assembly respectively. These ballots are then counted by a presiding officer who then transmits the results for their polling station to the returning officer (RO) in [[Form 45]]. Copies of Form 45 are also given to the observing [[polling agent]]s of the contesting candidates. The RO then consolidates these Form 45s, in front of the contesting candidates of the constituency they are overseeing, to give a provisional result in [[Form 47]] before doing a final consolidation in [[Form 48]]. The ECP then uses the data from Forms 47 and 48 to officially notify elected members for each constituency using [[Form 49]], provided that no candidate contested the unofficial consolidated counts given in Form 48.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-07 |title=Elections 2024: Comprehensive overview of Forms 45–49 |url=https://www.nation.com.pk/07-Feb-2024/elections-2024-comprehensive-overview-of-forms-45-49 |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=The Nation |language=en-US |archive-date=8 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240208165450/https://www.nation.com.pk/07-Feb-2024/elections-2024-comprehensive-overview-of-forms-45-49 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 2 November 2023, President [[Arif Alvi]] and the ECP agreed on holding general elections on 8 February, after a meeting was held in [[Aiwan-i-Sadr]] on the orders of the Supreme Court.

In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)).

== Security concerns and violence ==
The ECP categorised half the country's 90,675 polling stations as either "sensitive", meaning there is a risk of violence, or "most sensitive", indicating a higher risk. The classifications were based on the area's security situation and history of electoral violence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68226228 |title=Pakistan holds election tainted by rigging claims |work=BBC |date=8 February 2024 |access-date=8 February 2024 |archive-date=8 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240208002730/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68226228 |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Balochistan Province]] alone, caretaker provincial home minister Muhammad Zubair Jamali said that almost 80% of its 5,028 polling stations had been declared "sensitive".<ref name="guardian">{{Cite news |last=Baloch |first=Shah Meer |date=2024-02-07 |title=At least 30 killed in two bombings at election offices in Pakistan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/bombings-at-election-offices-in-pakistan |access-date=2024-02-07 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207102221/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/bombings-at-election-offices-in-pakistan |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Pre-poll violence ===

On 25 January 2024, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]] pledged not to stage attacks on election rallies and would limit itself to attacking military and police targets during the election period. This followed the government's decision to deploy troops in sensitive constituencies after intelligence agencies warned that militants could target rallies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-taliban-deny-threats-elections-db8ca74319bf5639c32c4ae7372e6a09 |title=Pakistani Taliban pledge not to attack election rallies ahead of Feb. 8 vote |work=Associated Press |date=25 January 2024 |access-date=25 January 2024 |archive-date=25 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240125115534/https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-taliban-deny-threats-elections-db8ca74319bf5639c32c4ae7372e6a09 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two candidates were killed during the election campaign. On 10 January, Malik Kaleem Ullah, an independent candidate for the [[Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], was shot dead while on a door-to-door sortie, while on 31 January, [[Rehan Zaib Khan]], an independent candidate affiliated with the PTI, was killed after gunmen opened fire on his car in a market in [[Bajaur]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], in an attack that also injured three people and was claimed by the [[Islamic State – Khorasan Province]] (ISIS-K). On 30 January, four people were killed and five others injured in an explosion during a PTI rally in [[Sibi]], [[Balochistan Province]], while on 31 January, 15 people were injured in attacks on residences and offices of PPP candidates and the election office of the PML-N in Balochistan, which was partially claimed by the [[Baloch Liberation Army]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/asia/pakistan-election-candidate-killed-intl-hnk/index.html |title=Pakistan election candidate shot dead as violence escalates ahead of nationwide vote |work=CNN |date=1 February 2024 |access-date=5 February 2024 |archive-date=5 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205102205/https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/asia/pakistan-election-candidate-killed-intl-hnk/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 7 February, [[2024 Balochistan bombings|29 people were killed in explosions]] outside an independent candidate's office and an office of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]] (JUI-F) in Balochistan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-bombing-baluchistan-killed-election-471783e425dcfc0e63c235da23c52a73 |title=Bombings at Pakistani political offices kill at least 29 a day before parliamentary elections |work=Associated Press |date=7 February 2024 |access-date=7 February 2024 |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207160132/https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-bombing-baluchistan-killed-election-471783e425dcfc0e63c235da23c52a73 |url-status=live }}</ref> Both attacks were claimed by ISIS-K.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-02-07 |title=Bomb blasts kill dozens day before Pakistan vote |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68226516 |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB |archive-date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240207094824/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68226516 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Inauguration of the National Assembly====
President Arif Alvi declined to convene the National Assembly's inaugural session, which is typically summoned within 21 days of the general elections as per the constitution. He was also of the view that Assembly was not complete and therefore the ECP should distribute the reserved seats for women and minorities to the PTI-backed SIC bloc.

On 29 February, a total of 302 newly elected legislators took their oaths, marking the commencement of the [[List of members of the 16th National Assembly of Pakistan|16th National Assembly]]. The maiden session, however, was disrupted by chaos and slogans in favour of Imran Khan. This was the first time where PTI MNAs were able (due to [[parliamentary privilege]]) to chant Imran Khan's name and display his photos on live TV since a ban was imposed on mentioning his name on television. The PTI's nominee for the premiership, [[Omar Ayub Khan]], along with PTI chair Gohar Ali Khan, emphasized during their addresses to the session that the Assembly remained incomplete as MNAs nominated for reserved seats were unable to attend the session and take the oath.<ref>{{cite news |title=New elected members take oath in inaugural session of 16th NA |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2457975/new-elected-members-take-oath-as-ruckus-mars-inaugural-session-of-16th-na |access-date=29 February 2024 |work=The Express Tribune |date=29 February 2024 |language=en |archive-date=29 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229210348/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2457975/new-elected-members-take-oath-as-ruckus-mars-inaugural-session-of-16th-na |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Newly elected representatives sworn in as ruckus mars maiden session of 16th National Assembly |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1818028/newly-elected-representatives-sworn-in-as-ruckus-mars-maiden-session-of-16th-national-assembly |access-date=29 February 2024 |work=dawn.com |date=29 February 2024 |language=en |archive-date=29 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229092021/https://www.dawn.com/news/1818028/newly-elected-representatives-sworn-in-as-ruckus-mars-maiden-session-of-16th-national-assembly |url-status=live }}</ref> On 4 March, a five-member bench of the ECP, chaired by CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, delivered a much-awaited 4-1 verdict to dismiss the plea from the PTI/SIC for reserved seats in the National Assembly.

It also noted that "the state must realise that, sometimes, a vote for the underdog is a vote against the establishment".<ref>{{cite news |title=Respect the mandate |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1812962 |work=DAWN |date=10 February 2024 |language=en |access-date=11 February 2024 |archive-date=12 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240212143415/https://www.dawn.com/news/1812962 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dawn referred to the largest number of independent candidates winning in a party-based election as a significant development in Pakistan's electoral history, describing it as a "seismic shift" and a clear message from the public that sidelining PTI and depriving them of their election symbol would not alter the election's trajectory.<ref>{{cite news |title=Independents' test |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1813484/independents-test |access-date=12 February 2024 |work=dawn.com |date=12 February 2024 |language=en |archive-date=12 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240212030820/https://www.dawn.com/news/1813484/independents-test |url-status=live }}</ref>
