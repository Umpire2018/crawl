The '''2024 Papua New Guinean unrest''' occurred on 10 January 2024 in [[Papua New Guinea]]'s capital [[Port Moresby]], later spreading to [[Lae]] and other cities. The unrest began following protests by security officers due to a sudden reduction in their salaries and prime minister [[James Marape]]'s [[tax deduction]] announcement which was later retracted. The riots saw [[arson]], [[looting]] and various civil unrests.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kuku |first1=Rebecca |date=10 January 2024 |title=Moresby burns |url=https://www.thenational.com.pg/moresby-burns/ |access-date=11 January 2024 |work=The National |archive-date=13 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240113172306/https://www.thenational.com.pg/moresby-burns/ |url-status=live }}</ref> An estimated, 22 people were killed from the incident.<ref name="abc22"/> James Marape, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, later declared a state of emergency for 14 days and suspended the country's police chief and several top officials.<ref name="ajpng">{{cite news|title=Papua New Guinea declares state of emergency after 15 killed in riots|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/at-least-15-dead-in-papua-new-guinea-rioting-and-looting|website=Al Jazeera|date=11 January 2024|access-date=11 January 2024|archive-date=11 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111050148/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/at-least-15-dead-in-papua-new-guinea-rioting-and-looting|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background==
The riots came amidst socioeconomic issues affecting the country such as rising inflation and high unemployment.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|date=11 January 2024|title=Papua New Guinea: At least 15 dead after major rioting and looting|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67942289|access-date=11 January 2024|work=BBC News|archive-date=11 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111025639/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67942289|url-status=live}}</ref> The unrest was triggered after police and other public servants staged a protest strike outside parliament on Wednesday, after discovering that their wages had been reduced by up to 50% in their latest pay cheques. In response, Mr Marape said the pay cut was an error due to a computer glitch - which had deducted up to $100 (£78) from the pay cheques of public servants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Riots in Papua New Guinea Are a Warning: Urgent Change is Needed |url=https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/01/riots-papua-new-guinea-are-warning-urgent-change-needed |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=United States Institute of Peace |language=en}}</ref> He said the administrative error would be corrected in next month's payments. But this answer was not accepted by many protesters, some of whom then tried to push into the parliament building - with footage showing people torching a car outside the prime minister's compound and overrunning a gate'''.'''<ref name="rtl"/>
