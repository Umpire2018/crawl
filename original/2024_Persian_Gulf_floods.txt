===Cloud seeding allegations===
In the aftermath of the floods, some news outlets quoted specialist meteorologist Ahmed Habib linking the heavy downpours to the UAE's [[cloud seeding]] program.<ref>{{Cite news |date=16 April 2024 |title=Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/dubai-grinds-to-standstill-as-cloud-seeding-worsens-flooding |access-date=18 April 2024 |work=Bloomberg.com |language=en |archive-date=17 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417143209/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/dubai-grinds-to-standstill-as-cloud-seeding-worsens-flooding |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to the arid desert climate and high temperatures, [[Cloud seeding in the United Arab Emirates|cloud seeding has been used previously in the United Arab Emirates]] to combat water scarcity, which has been alleged to cause the severe thunderstorm system.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vlamis |first=Kelsey |title=Photos of torrential Dubai flash floods show the downsides of trying to control the weather |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-dubai-airport-flash-floods-show-downsides-controlling-the-weather-2024-4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417080342/https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-dubai-airport-flash-floods-show-downsides-controlling-the-weather-2024-4 |archive-date=17 April 2024 |access-date=17 April 2024 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref>

Dismissing the allegations, Omar Al Yazeedi, the deputy director-general of the UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), said the institution "did not conduct any seeding operations during this event".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Did controversial 'cloud seeding' flights cause torrential downpours and huge flooding in Dubai? |url=https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/uae-dubai-united-arab-emirtates-cloud-seeding-flooding-rainfall/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417153848/https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/uae-dubai-united-arab-emirtates-cloud-seeding-flooding-rainfall/ |archive-date=17 April 2024 |access-date=17 April 2024 |website=LBC |language=en}}</ref> Other news commentators have also dismissed the link to cloud seeding, stating that the technology marginally increases rainfall and that the UAE's cloud seeding program is localised to the eastern part of the country, away from densely populated metropolitan areas; other experts, such as the Royal Meteorological Society, stated that cloud seeding would only have a minimal effect,<ref name=":6" /> with others even stating that the focus on cloud seeding is "misleading".<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 April 2024 |title=What is cloud seeding and did it cause Dubai flooding? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68839043 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417220232/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68839043 |archive-date=17 April 2024 |access-date=18 April 2024 |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

Scientists from the [[University of Reading]], whose cloud seeding program is used by the UAE, denied that cloud seeding was to blame for the heavy rainfall, given that the large-scale weather pattern was predicted in advance and was too large to be influenced by cloud seeding. They added that the effects of cloud seeding are typically short-lived, lasting for a few hours and only impacted a particular region.<ref name=":4" />
