[[File:New Hebrides Plate map-fr.png|thumb|left|Map of the New Hebrides plate (in [[French language|French]])]]
The primary feature of the Vanuatuan archipelago, located on its west-southwest, is the [[New Hebrides Trench]], the [[Convergent boundary|convergent]] boundary between the [[Australian plate|Australian]] and [[New Hebrides plate]]s. Along the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]], earthquake activity has been observed as shallow, intermediate, and [[Deep-focus earthquake|deep-focus]] events at depths of up to {{cvt|700|km}}. Volcanic activity is also present along this north-northwest trending and northeast-[[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[subduction|subduction zone]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Yeats |first=R. |title=Active Faults of the World |date=2012 |page=478 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQUgAwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521190855}}</ref> This subduction zone is one of the most active plate boundaries globally, moving at a rate of approximately {{cvt|170|mm|in|0}} per year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Vanuatu quake in world's most active zone |url=https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/news/vanuatu-quake-in-worlds-most-active-zone/ |access-date=19 December 2024 |website=Fiji Broadcasting Corporation |archive-date=19 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241219004539/https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/news/vanuatu-quake-in-worlds-most-active-zone/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

While much of the [[island arc]] experiences intermediate-depth earthquakes along a Wadati–Benioff zone that dips steeply at 70°, the area adjacent to the [[d'Entrecasteaux Ridge|D'entrecasteaux Ridge]] does not. There is a corresponding gap in seismicity that occurs below {{cvt|50|km}} where it enters the subduction zone from the west. According to the NUVEL-1 global relative plate motion model, convergence is occurring at roughly {{cvt|8|cm}} per year. The uncertainty, which also affects the [[Tonga Arc]], is due to the influence of [[Divergent boundary|spreading]] at the [[North Fiji Basin]]. Of the 58 {{M|w|7.0|link=y}} or greater events that occurred between 1909 and 2001, few were studied.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Frolich |first=C. |title=Deep Earthquakes |date=2006 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0805836523 |pages=399–401}}</ref>

== Earthquake ==
The earthquake struck some {{convert|8|km}} off the western coast of [[Efate]].<ref name="ANSS"/> The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) placed the earthquake at {{M|w|7.3}} with a depth of {{convert|54.4|km}}. The [[focal mechanism]] indicated [[Fault (geology)#Oblique-slip faults|oblique-normal faulting]]. Together with the [[hypocenter|hypocentral]] depth, this implied faulting within the [[Subduction|subducting]] Australian plate. The USGS proposed two finite fault models: one depicting rupture on a northwest-trending fault with a shallow west-southwest dip, and the other on an east-northeast fault with a near-vertical dip. Both rupture models indicated a maximum slip of {{cvt|3|m}}.<ref name="ANSS">{{cite anss |M 7.3 – 24 km WNW of Port-Vila, Vanuatu|2024 |pt24352000 }}</ref> Shaking was estimated to have lasted for around 30 seconds.<ref name="abc">{{Cite news |date=17 December 2024 |title=Why earthquakes are more common in places such as Vanuatu |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-17/why-earthquakes-are-common-in-vanuatu/104738148 |access-date=17 December 2024 |work=ABC Australia}}</ref> Over 300 aftershocks were recorded,<ref name="rnzlive2">{{Cite news|date=18 December 2024|title=Live: Rescue efforts continue in Vanuatu, international assistance begins to arrive|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/537080/live-rescue-efforts-continue-in-vanuatu-international-assistance-begins-to-arrive|access-date=18 December 2024|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|archive-date=18 December 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241218174824/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/537080/live-rescue-efforts-continue-in-vanuatu-international-assistance-begins-to-arrive|url-status=live}}</ref> with the strongest measuring {{M|w|6.1}} on 22 December.<ref name="aftershock6.1">{{Cite news |date=22 December 2024 |title=Large earthquake hits battered Vanuatu |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241221-strong-quake-strikes-off-battered-vanuatu |access-date=22 December 2024 |work=France 24}}</ref> The earthquake with its current depth was significantly smaller than {{M|w|8}} earthquakes typically responsible for generating damaging tsunamis.<ref name=":0" />
