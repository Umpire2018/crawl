==Background==
The elections followed deadly clashes triggered by proposed changes to the electoral system by current leader [[Said Abdullahi Deni]]. Deni had sought to implement direct elections for the presidency. However, in November 2023 the proposal was abandoned as armed opposition politicians and clan elders opposed it, underscoring the ongoing complexities surrounding democratic processes in Puntland.<ref name="Bloomberg.com"/>

UN Special Representative [[Catriona Laing]] acknowledged the state's leaders for their notable efforts in engaging diverse groups. Laing urged President Deni to extend this outreach beyond opposition leaders, elders, and clan representatives, emphasizing the inclusion of youth, women, and scholars. The objective is to build consensus and ensure a peaceful electoral process during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, slated for February 2024, as proposed by the [[Puntland Electoral Commission|Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC)]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-11 |title=Remarks by the UN Special Representative for Somalia, Catriona Laing, to the media, during her visit to Garowe, Puntland |url=https://unsom.unmissions.org/remarks-un-special-representative-somalia-catriona-laing-media-during-her-visit-garowe-puntland-1 |access-date=2023-12-20 |website=UNSOM |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=ACLED |first=Communications |date=2023-07-28 |title=Somalia Situation Update: July 2023 {{!}} Political Crisis Deepens Amid Transition to Direct Elections |url=https://acleddata.com/2023/07/28/somalia-situation-update-july-2023-electoral-crisis-deepens-as-somalia-transitions-to-direct-elections/ |access-date=2023-12-25 |website=ACLED |language=en-US}}</ref>

She reaffirmed the United Nations' dedication to collaborating with the Puntland government and its people, working towards the realization of peaceful and inclusive parliamentary and presidential elections that gain recognition from all stakeholders.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN Special Representative discusses political and security developments in Puntland {{!}} Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs |url=https://dppa.un.org/en/un-special-representative-discusses-political-and-security-developments-puntland |access-date=2023-12-20 |website=dppa.un.org}}</ref>
