The result of the first round was a surprise, with independent [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] candidate [[Călin Georgescu]] achieving a [[relative majority]] of votes, while the center-right politician [[Elena Lasconi]] finished second and also advanced to the runoff vote. Initially viewed as a minor candidate with little chance of victory, Georgescu quickly gained significant support through campaigning on non-traditional media outlets such as [[TikTok]], receiving particular popularity among those disaffected with current Romanian politics, including [[Youth politics|youth]], [[farmer]]s, [[Urban–rural political divide|rural voters]], and members of the [[working class]].

== Background ==
Following consultations with various parliamentary groups, the government of Prime Minister [[Marcel Ciolacu]] announced on 4 July 2024 that presidential elections would take place later that year on 24 November for a first round and 8 December for a second round. It also set parliamentary elections for 1 December.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 July 2024 |title=Breaking: Coaliția anunță alegerile prezidențiale pe 24 noiembrie și 8 decembrie / Alegerile parlamentare pe 1 decembrie |url=https://www.g4media.ro/breaking-coalitia-anunta-alegerile-prezidentiale-pe-24-noiembrie-si-8-decembrie-alegerile-parlamentare-pe-1-decembrie.html |website=G4Media |language=ro}}</ref> Prior to this, there was a speculation according to which the forthcoming Romanian presidential elections might have occurred earlier than to term, in the event that incumbent President [[Klaus Iohannis]] would have been nominated as [[Secretary General of NATO]] and that he would have accepted the nomination in the meantime, then the election would have likely been called earlier than planned.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ioana Coman |date=5 July 2022 |title=Klaus Iohannis nu exclude posibilitatea de a ajunge șef la NATO |url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/klaus-iohannis-nu-exclude-posibilitatea-de-a-ajunge-sef-la-nato-2000807 |accessdate=6 July 2022 |work=Digi24.ro |language=ro}}</ref> This ultimately did not come to pass, as Dutch former Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] was chosen to succeed the incumbent Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 June 2024 |title=Mark Rutte will be NATO's next secretary-general |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/mark-rutte-will-be-natos-next-secretary-general/ |access-date=27 August 2024 |website=Politico |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Candidates ==
=== National Liberal Party (PNL) ===
President [[Klaus Iohannis]] was not eligible for another candidacy, therefore the party sought another suitable candidate.

=== Withdrawn candidates ===
These individuals were part of the race in some way and their plans stopped. Some failed to file their bid to BEC, withdrew from the race, or recanted their interest in the presidential office. Here are also included candidates who are no longer in the race due to their bid being rejected by BEC, or whose bid or candidacy were legally barred by the CCR, and a candidate that withdrew during the electoral campaign and announced his endorsement to another candidate, while his name remained on the ballot.

== Leading issues ==

=== Christianity in public life ===
The [[Role of Christianity in civilization|role of Christianity]] and [[patriotism]] in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian public life]] has become a leading issue in the campaign. Often both supported and mocked as "The TikTok Messiah" for his religious nationalist messaging and use of the app [[TikTok]], Georgescu has gained appeal among religious Romanians, appealing to [[natalism]], [[family values]], [[patriotism]], and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 November 2024 |title=Who is Calin Georgescu, Romania's far-right outsider and presidential contender? |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-calin-georgescu-romania-far-right-presidential-contender-9690250/lite/ |access-date=30 November 2024 |website=The Indian Express |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dumitru |first=Loredana |date=29 November 2024 |title=RFK Jr mulls Romania visit to meet 'TikTok Messiah' candidate |url=https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/29/trumps-health-pick-rfk-jr-might-visit-romania-to-meet-tiktok-messiah-candidate |access-date=30 November 2024 |website=euronews |language=en}}</ref>

=== Corruption ===
Both Călin Georgescu and Elena Lasconi have criticised [[corruption in Romania]], which has become central to their appeal.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ehl |first=Martin |date=27 November 2024 |title=Why the Romanian Elections Are a Warning for Central Europe |url=https://visegradinsight.eu/why-the-romanian-elections-are-a-warning-for-central-europe-commentary/ |access-date=30 November 2024 |website=Visegrad Insight |language=en-GB}}</ref> Georgescu has accused the mainstream political parties, particularly the [[National Coalition for Romania]] between the center-left [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] and the center-right [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], of fostering corruption.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Popoviciu |first=Andrei |date=29 November 2024 |title=My father voted for Romania's ultra-nationalist.

=== Geopolitics ===
Lasconi favours Romania closely aligning with the [[United States]], [[European Union]], and [[NATO]], while opposing Russia, while Georgescu has stated that he favours Romania's geopolitical [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] between the two power blocs.<ref name=":5" /> Georgescu has also pledged to end military aid to Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rainsford |first=Sarah |date=5 December 2024 |title=Romania's far right presidential frontrunner vows to end Ukraine aid |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6l06ldpqo |work=BBC}}</ref> Following the first round, Lasconi said that Romania was in "a historical confrontation between preserving Romania's young democracy ... and those who want to return Romania to the Russian sphere of influence". She also accused Georgescu of being an isolationist and an "open admirer of [[Vladimir Putin]]". Georgescu denied being an extremist or a fascist and said that he is "completely dedicated to the Romanian people", adding: "We remain directly linked to [[European values]], but we must find our (own) values."<ref name=":5">{{Cite news |last=McGrath |first=Stephen |date=26 November 2024 |title=A far-right populist shocks Romania by heading into the presidential runoff |url=https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-president-far-right-europe-40e369c404cbcb0ada3527c0aaf939b8 |work=Associated Press}}</ref>

=== LGBTQ rights ===
[[LGBTQ rights in Romania|LGBTQ rights]] are expected to be a major issue in the campaign. In the second round of the campaign, LGBTQ rights organizations have made strong endorsements for Lasconi, despite her past comments, while Georgescu explicitly rejects [[LGBTQ movements|LGBTQ rights movements]].<ref name=":4" /> Lasconi's positions have become significantly favourable towards LGBTQ rights. Earlier in 2023, Lasconi stated that she would have voted "Yes" during the [[2018 Romanian constitutional referendum|failed referendum on the constitutional prohibition of same-sex unions]]. Her daughter, Oana, subsequently denounced her as a "homophobe" and stated that she was "shocked and disgusted" at her mother.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 November 2024 |title=VIDEO. Elena Lasconi's daughter, testifies in tears after her mother's homophobic statements: I am shocked and disgusted |url=https://ground.news/article/elena-lasconis-daughter-after-her-mother-said-she-voted-yes-in-the-referendum-for-the-traditional-family-i-am-in-shock-and-absolutely-disgusted-this-blatant-discrimination-does-not-ta |access-date=30 November 2024 |website=Ground News |language=en}}</ref> Lasconi immediately retracted this position, stated that she does not oppose [[Civil union|civil unions]] or (in the distant future) [[Same-sex marriage|marriage for LGBTQ couples]], while stating that her party remains open for individuals who are [[Transgender|gender]] or [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], and that the party is open to all, "be they ... [[atheists]] [or] [[LGBTQ]] individuals".<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=25 November 2024 |title=Elena Lasconi: a családjogi népszavazástól a második fordulóig |url=https://transtelex.ro/kozelet/2024/11/25/elena-lasconi-a-csaladjogi-nepszavazastol-a-masodik-forduloig |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=transtelex |language=hu}}</ref>

==Debates==
The debates{{efn|In order for a debate to be counted as such, there must be at least two candidates present. The following situations are not considered proper debates: one candidate with one or multiple interviewers; one candidate with a representative (or more) of other candidate(s); only representatives of candidates (no matter how many candidates were represented); one candidate debating a previously recorded video of other candidate(s); short live statements of a candidate (via telephone or video streaming) inserted during a show with only one (other) candidate; short coincidental encounters of candidates (in a non-previously organised debate) that spoke to each other (and were recorded, even on professional cameras in TV studios). Any debate must be publicly broadcast. Negotiations behind closed doors, "strategic meetings" among candidates or any other type of discreet talks are not proper debates, even if their content (or bits of it) was released to the public, with/without the candidates' approval of its release.
<p>Debates may be broadcast on radio, television, or the internet. Candidates may show up in person or participate in the debate via telephone or video streaming for the entire debate time. Candidates who left the debate before 10% of the debate time elapsed (after a few words or several minutes) are considered absentees and their leaving is noted as such. In this particular situation (if it will occur), the debate is considered a valid one, because at least two candidates were present at its beginning. Candidates who left before the debate's ending are considered present, with their particular situation noted as such. Re-runs or syndication are not counted as different debates.</p>}} started on 28 October 2024, three days after the start of the campaign. The last first round debate was broadcast on 21 November 2024, 8:30 hours before the electoral campaign ended. There had been 38 broadcast debates: 30 televised, six on the radio and three online. The broadcasters were:
* [[TVR Info]] (seven debates and one in syndication);
* [[Radio România Actualități]] (six debates);
* [[TVR 1]] (five debates);
* [[Digi24]] (four debates);
* [[TVR Timișoara]] (three debates);
* [[:ro:Euronews România|Euronews România]], [[România TV]], [[B1 TV]] and Metropola TV (each with two debates)
* A7 TV, [[Gândul]], [[Antena 3 (Romania)|Antena 3]], [[:ro:Ștefan Mandachi|Ștefan Mandachi]]'s video podcast, [[:ro:Cosmin Nedelcu|Cosmin Nedelcu]]'s video podcast, [[TVR Moldova]] and [[TVRi|TVR International]] (each with a sole debate; the last two only in syndication).

The [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberals]] marked their worst ever result in a presidential race, as [[Nicolae Ciucă]] ended up in fifth place with 8.79% of the vote. [[Right-wing populism|Right-wing populist]] [[George Simion]] also registered a weak result, after it was widely speculated he would advance to the second round in December.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McGrath |first=Stephen |date=25 November 2024 |title=Far-right populist surprises in Romanian presidential election appearing set to enter runoff |url=https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-president-europe-nato-a6e3bd3f26272c4a9ab9337789f09da8 |work=Associated Press News (AP)}}</ref>

{{Main|Accusations of Russian interference in the 2024 Romanian presidential election}}
After failing to advance to the runoff, Marcel Ciolacu announced his resignation as leader of the Social Democratic Party on 25 November; however, he will remain the Prime Minister until a new government is formed following [[2024 Romanian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 1 December.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romania-insider.com/marcel-ciolacu-resigns-leader-psd-presidential-defeat-2024|title=Marcel Ciolacu resigns|access-date=25 November 2024|website=Romania Insider|date=25 November 2024 }}</ref> Nicolae Ciucă also resigned as leader of the National Liberal Party after failing to advance to the runoff.<ref name="annul"/> Amid discussion over the role of social media in Călin Georgescu's strong showing, Ciolacu also called for funding for Georgescu's campaign on [[TikTok]] to be reviewed, while [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] and [[Renew Europe]] leader [[Valérie Hayer]] called on TikTok's CEO to answer questions about the platform's role in the election before the [[European Parliament]], citing the [[Digital Services Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/elections-tiktok-ceo-eu-parliament-romania-election-fake-accounts-pro-russia-calin-georgescu-nato-shock-victory/ |title=TikTok CEO summoned to European Parliament over role in shock Romania election |access-date=26 November 2024 |website=Politico|date=26 November 2024 }}</ref> The [[National Audiovisual Council]] of Romania also called for the [[European Commission]] to investigate TikTok's role in the election, while the national telecommunications regulator Ancom called for TikTok to be suspended as part of an investigation into electoral manipulation. Romanian president [[Klaus Iohannis]] also accused TikTok of failing to mark Georgescu's account as that of a political candidate. TikTok subsequently denied favouring Georgescu. Protests also broke out against Georgescu in Bucharest and several other cities in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n83vgxxjo |title=Romania orders election recount after TikTok bias claims |date=28 November 2024 |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=BBC |language=en}}</ref> An analysis by the Romanian news outlet [[G4 Media (website)|G4 Media]] found that Georgescu mounted a "propaganda machine" using thousands of supposed "volunteers" to spread his campaign messaging, adding that those involved received pre-made materials on [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] that could readily be posted as comments on TikTok and other platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241128-tiktok-tactics-shake-up-politics-in-romania |title=TikTok tactics shake up politics in Romania |date=28 November 2024 |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=France 24 |language=en}}</ref> TikTok executives said that they had taken down several networks engaged in election interference in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-romania-election-eu-lawmakers-7a304848ed94390ed01c5170ee592a12 |title=TikTok defends handling of Romania election content in grilling by EU lawmakers |date=3 December 2024 |access-date=3 December 2024 |website=Associated Press |language=en}}</ref> 

On 27 November, two minor candidates, Sebastian Constantin Popescu and [[Cristian Terheș]] submitted requests to the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] to annul the results of the first round of the election.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doi candidaţi solicită Curţii Constituţionale anularea rezultatelor primului tur al alegerilor prezidențiale.

Popescu accused Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, of failing to disclose financing linked to TikTok. The Central Election Bureau later said that scanned reports were due to be delivered by 1 December and the original ballots by 3 December.<ref name="aprecount">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-president-recount-georgescu-far-right-34f4284d54ea34a841225e2c3a968c6d |title=Romania orders election recount after TikTok bias claims |date=28 November 2024 |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=Associated Press |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Supreme Council of National Defence (Romania)|Supreme Council of National Defence]] convened and called for an investigation into alleged attacks on the electoral infrastructure and suspicions of illegal campaigning by Călin Georgescu.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 November 2024 |title=Ședința CSAT s-a încheiat.

==Annulment==
{{see also|2024–2025 Romanian election annulment protests}}
On 2 December, the Constitutional Court ruled unanimously to confirm the first round results and upheld the organisation of the runoff on 8 December between Georgescu and Lasconi;<ref name=":6" /> however, the Court reversed its decision on 6 December and annulled the election results after President Iohannis allowed the declassification of information in the [[Supreme Council of National Defence (Romania)|Supreme Council of National Defence]]. The Romanian Service of Information also declared that Georgescu said he had a "Zero lei electoral campaign budget", but subsequent investigations revealed an undeclared donation of up to €1,000,000 from third parties. This prompted the Court to annul the election results.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ultimă oră. Alegerile prezidențiale din România au fost anulate.

The annulment was condemned by both Georgescu and Lasconi, with Georgescu describing the court's verdict as a "formalised [[coup d'état]]",<ref name="i090">{{cite web | last=Rainsford | first=Sarah | title=Romanian court annuls result of presidential election first round | website=BBC Home | date=6 December 2024 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4x2epppego | access-date=6 December 2024}}</ref> and Lasconi calling it "illegal [and] immoral" and stating that it "crushes the very essence of democracy". Fourth-placed George Simion also called the verdict a "coup d'état in full swing" but urged against street protests. Third-placed Marcel Ciolacu called the annulment "the only correct decision".<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 December 2024 |title=Romanian court annuls result of presidential election first round |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4x2epppego |access-date=6 December 2024 |website=BBC |language=en}}</ref> 

President Iohannis also said the court's decision was legitimate and should be respected, adding that he would remain in office until a successor is inaugurated.<ref name="m109">{{cite web | last=Brezar | first=Aleksandar | title=Romanian president: Court's annulment of election must be respected | website=euronews | date=6 December 2024 | url=https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/06/courts-decision-to-annul-romanian-presidential-election-must-be-respected-president-iohann | access-date=6 December 2024}}</ref> [[Accusations of Russian interference in the 2024 Romanian presidential election|Russian state interference]] in the election was widely reported, including state-sponsored [[cyberattacks]], and the annulment was described as "an extraordinary step" by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" />

On 7 December, prosecutors searched properties across the country in an investigation into the financing of a candidate's campaign, with investigators saying [[money laundering]] was used to fund the campaign.

On the day of the cancelled runoff, Georgescu and around 100 of his supporters held a protest outside a polling station in Bucharest demanding that the election be held.

On 21 December, the political magazine [[Politico Europe]] reported that the pro-European PNL had financed a general political campaign, the hashtags of which were then used to promote Georgescu.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goury-Laffont |first=Victor |date=21 December 2024 |title=Report ties Romanian liberals to TikTok campaign that fueled pro-Russia candidate |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/investigation-ties-romanian-liberals-tiktok-campaign-pro-russia-candidate-calin-georgescu/ |access-date=24 December 2024 |website=Politico |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Some Romanian politicians supported Georgescu's participation in the new presidential elections in May 2025.

On 21 January, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] rejected an appeal by Georgescu to reverse the annulment, saying that it did not have jurisdiction over the case.<ref>{{cite web | title=Europe rights court rejects appeal of Romania vote annulment | website=France 24 | date=21 January 2025 | url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250121-europe-rights-court-rejects-appeal-of-romania-vote-annulment | access-date=21 January 2025}}</ref>
