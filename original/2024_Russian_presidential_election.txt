=== Rejected candidates ===
Individuals in this section have had their document submissions accepted by the CEC to register their participation, and later gathered the necessary signatures from voters. The deadline to submit documents was 27 December 2023 for independents and 1 January 2024 for party-based nominations, with the commission already announcing the rejection of some candidates based on alleged issues with their paperwork.<ref name="Ведомости">{{Cite news |title=ЛДПР выдвинула Слуцкого кандидатом в президенты России |language=ru |work=Ведомости |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2023/12/19/1011800-ldpr-vidvinula-slutskogo-kandidatom-v-prezidenti-rossii |access-date=19 December 2023 |archive-date=19 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231219111954/https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2023/12/19/1011800-ldpr-vidvinula-slutskogo-kandidatom-v-prezidenti-rossii |url-status=live }}</ref>

Towards the deadline to submit documents, the CEC stated that 33 potential candidates were intending to be registered as candidates (24 independents and 9 party-based nominations). The commission accepted the documents of 15 candidates.<ref>{{Citation |title=Документы в ЦИК представили шесть самовыдвиженцев и девять кандидатов от партий |url=https://www.1tv.ru/news/2023-12-28/467950-dokumenty_v_tsik_predstavili_shest_samovydvizhentsev_i_devyat_kandidatov_ot_partiy |access-date=29 December 2023 |language=ru |trans-title=Six self-nominated candidates and nine party candidates submitted documents to the CEC |website=[[Channel One Russia]] |archive-date=28 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231228183642/https://www.1tv.ru/news/2023-12-28/467950-dokumenty_v_tsik_predstavili_shest_samovydvizhentsev_i_devyat_kandidatov_ot_partiy |url-status=live }}</ref>

The next step was to collect signatures by 31 January 2024. Independents had to gather 300,000 signatures from the public in at least 40 of Russia's [[Federal Subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] to support their participation and thereby be included on the ballot, while potential candidates nominated by political parties that are not represented in the [[State Duma]] or in at least a third of the country's [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliaments]] had to gather 100,000 signatures.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Правила регистрации кандидатов-самовыдвиженцев на выборах президента РФ |url=https://tass.ru/info/19557601 |access-date=18 December 2023 |website=Tass |archive-date=18 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231218145235/https://tass.ru/info/19557601 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The CEC accepted the signatures of Putin, while rejecting Nadezhdin and Malinkovich on the basis of what it described to be irregularities. Davankov, Kharitonov and Slutsky were not required to collect signatures as they were nominated by political parties represented in the State Duma. This confirmed the final number of candidates at four.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

==Party congresses and primaries==
Congresses of political parties are held after the official appointment of election. At the congress, a party can either nominate its own candidate, or support a candidate nominated by another party or an independent candidate. Twelve parties held party congresses in December 2023, at which candidates were either nominated or endorsed.

At [[Yabloko]]'s congress, which took place on 9 December 2023, somewhat unconventionally, the party decided that [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] would run for president as its nominee if he obtains 10 million signatures from potential voters,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Об участии в президентских выборах 2024 года |url=https://www.yabloko.ru/reshenija_politicheskogo_komiteta/2023/12/07-0 |access-date=21 December 2023 |website=Yabloko |language=ru |archive-date=23 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223043839/https://www.yabloko.ru/reshenija_politicheskogo_komiteta/2023/12/07-0 |url-status=live }}</ref> which is higher than the total number of votes Yavlinsky obtained [[1996 Russian presidential election|during his most successful run for president]] (5.55 million).<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 December 2023 |title=Кто может стать миллионером |trans-title=Who can become a millionaire |url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6394455 |access-date=21 December 2023 |website=Kommersant |language=ru |archive-date=20 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231220153129/https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6394455 |url-status=live }}</ref> Yabloko later stated that it would not be nominating any candidate.<ref name="vedomosti.ru">{{Cite news |title="Яблоко" передумало выдвигать кандидата на выборы президента |language=ru |work=Ведомости |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2023/12/23/1012623-yavlinskii |access-date=23 December 2023 |archive-date=23 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223113707/https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2023/12/23/1012623-yavlinskii |url-status=live }}</ref> Furthermore, Yavlinsky only managed to gather around a million signatures.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 December 2023 |title=Явлинский отказался от выдвижения в президенты |url=https://www.rbc.ru/politics/23/12/2023/6586c7e49a7947a4eed6d3c6 |access-date=23 December 2023 |website=RBC |language=ru |archive-date=23 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223115727/https://www.rbc.ru/politics/23/12/2023/6586c7e49a7947a4eed6d3c6 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to an investigation published in February 2024 by a coalition of journals including [[VSquare]], [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]], [[Expressen]] and [[Paper Trail Media]], Putin ordered Decree Number 2016, titled "On deputy heads responsible for social and political work of federal government agencies", on 17 February 2023. The decree stated its aim of coordination between the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science]] and other state agencies to "increase the number of voters and the support of the main candidates" in the 2024 presidential election and other elections. Documents from a governmental "non-profit organisation", ANO Integration, highlighted the emphasis on increasing the number of voters and the support of the main candidates, with turnout being used to indicate the scale of support and opposition to Putin.<ref name="VSquare_KremlinLeaks">{{cite Q|Q124672623|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="meduza-election">{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/03/04/people-don-t-want-to-vote|title='People don't want to vote' How the Kremlin plans to compensate for Russians' record-low interest in the country's upcoming election|website=Meduza|date=4 March 2024|access-date=15 March 2024|archive-date=15 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315174244/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/03/04/people-don-t-want-to-vote|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ANO Integration documents presented a plan to create lists of all employees and sub-lists of opinion leaders in institutions within the ministry's responsibility, and to monitor political attitudes and voting preferences and "increas[e] [the employee's] level of socio-political literacy". The documents planned for the preparation of secret instructions for social events in which selected opinion leaders and "experts" would meet with students and teachers in preparation for the election. {{ill|Martin Kragh|sv}} of the [[Center for East European Studies]] in Stockholm described the documents by stating, "All these documents show how little the Kremlin believes that people might just spontaneously support the ruling party". [[Mark Galeotti]], a British historian, lecturer and writer, described the process as "pre-rigging" the election in order to minimise the amount of manipulation needed in the numbers of votes cast for Putin in the election.

When asked by a BBC journalist about his electoral campaign, [[Nikolay Kharitonov]] refused to answer why he thought he would be a better candidate than Putin, before proceeding to praise the latter for "trying to solve a lot of the problems of the 1990s" and consolidating the country for "victory in all areas".<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 March 2024 |title=Russia election: Stage-managed vote will give Putin another term |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68543919 |access-date=14 March 2024 |website=BBC News |language=en |archive-date=14 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240314034849/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68543919 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly after filing his candidacy in December 2023, [[Leonid Slutsky (politician)|Leonid Slutsky]] said he did not "dream of beating Putin" and predicted that the latter would achieve "a huge victory".<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 March 2024 |title=Russia's presidential election: Three Putin challengers but little suspense |url=https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240315-russia-presidential-election-three-candidates-putin-slutsky-kharitonov-davankov-little-suspense |access-date=15 March 2024 |website=France 24 |language=en |archive-date=15 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315162005/https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240315-russia-presidential-election-three-candidates-putin-slutsky-kharitonov-davankov-little-suspense |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Vladislav Davankov]] said he would not criticize his political opponents.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia elections: Everything you need to know about sham presidential polls that will hand Putin fifth term |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-elections-2024-voting-candidates-putin-b2513938.html |work=The Independent |date=17 March 2024 |access-date=17 March 2024 |archive-date=17 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240317142632/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-elections-2024-voting-candidates-putin-b2513938.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Allegations of fraud==
===Statistical analyses===
According to a ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' investigation using a method proposed by mathematician {{ill|Sergey Shpilkin|ru|Шпилькин, Сергей Александрович}}, around 22 million of the non-online (polling booth) votes for Putin were [[electoral fraud|falsified]], out of 64.7 million non-online votes for Putin in total. ''Novaya Gazeta'' described the analysis showing "record levels of fraud even for a Russian presidential election".<ref name="NovayaGazeta_at_least_22M">{{cite Q|Q125026372|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="novayagazeta">{{cite web|url=https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/03/18/novaia-evropa-okolo-poloviny-golosov-za-vladimira-putina-na-prezidentskikh-vyborakh-byli-vbrosheny-news|title=Исследование «Новой-Европа»: около половины голосов за Владимира Путина на президентских выборах были вброшены|language=Russian|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|date=18 March 2024|accessdate=18 March 2024|archive-date=18 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240318134823/https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/03/18/novaia-evropa-okolo-poloviny-golosov-za-vladimira-putina-na-prezidentskikh-vyborakh-byli-vbrosheny-news|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Meduza]]'' carried out statistical analyses on the official results released by the CEC. Based on [[scatter plot]]s of the vote percentage for Putin compared to turnout, a tail in which [[voter turnout]] visually correlates to Putin support, which appeared weakly in earlier Russian presidential elections, was found by ''Meduza'' to completely dominate in 2024. "[[Vladimir Churov|Churov]]'s saw", a statistical effect interpreted as fraudulent in which sharp peaks at round numbers appear in voter turnout and percentage votes for Putin, was found by ''Meduza'' to have strengthened in the 2024 election, with ''Meduza'' arguing that the number of polling stations with likely fraud became the majority in 2024, while earlier the fraction of fraudulent polling stations had been a minority. Overall, ''Meduza'' stated that the 2024 presidential election "was almost certainly the most fraudulent" in "modern Russian history", and that the "sheer magnitude of fraud eclipses that of [[2018 Russian presidential election|2018]]".<ref name="Meduza_breaks_down_evidence">{{cite Q|Q125025516|url-status=live}}</ref>
