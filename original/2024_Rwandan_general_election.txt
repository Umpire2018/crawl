==Background==
A [[2015 Rwandan constitutional referendum|referendum in 2015]] approved constitutional amendments that would allow incumbent President [[Paul Kagame]] to run for a third term in office in 2017, as well as shortening presidential terms from seven to five years, although the latter change would not come into effect until 2024.<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35049885|title=Paul Kagame's third term: Rwanda referendum on 18 December|website=BBC News|date=9 December 2015|access-date=20 January 2023|archive-date=23 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123045750/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35049885|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2022 Kagame told [[France 24]] that he intended to run for president again in the 2024 election, despite having already served three terms in office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62105226 |title=Paul Kagame to seek fourth term as president of Rwanda |date=9 July 2022 |work=BBC News |access-date=5 April 2023 |archive-date=11 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111171116/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62105226 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kagame's rule in the country has been described as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. According to [[Freedom House]], Kagame is an autocrat who is responsible for "surveillance, intimidation, torture and [[Rendition (law)|renditions]] or suspected assassinations of exiled [[Dissident|dissidents]]".
