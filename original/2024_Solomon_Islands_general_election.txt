{{Politics of the Solomon Islands}}

General elections were held in [[Solomon Islands]] on 17 April 2024 to determine the composition of the 12th Parliament.<ref name=day>{{cite news |last1=Sasako |first1=Alfred |title=It's 17th April |url=https://www.solomonstarnews.com/its-17th-april/ |access-date=29 January 2024 |work=[[Solomon Star]] |date=27 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240129023721/https://www.solomonstarnews.com/its-17th-april/ |archive-date=29 January 2024|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Delayed Solomons Election Set For April 17 |url=https://www.barrons.com/news/delayed-solomons-election-set-for-april-17-c692e0a1 |work=Barron's |date=24 January 2024 |access-date=29 January 2024 |archive-date=29 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240129084257/https://www.barrons.com/news/delayed-solomons-election-set-for-april-17-c692e0a1 |url-status=live }}</ref> Initially planned for 2023, parliament voted in 2022 to delay the elections. Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] claimed the country could not afford to have an election in the same year the Solomon Islands were hosting the [[2023 Pacific Games|Pacific Games]]. The opposition condemned the delay and accused Sogavare of a power grab.<ref name=1guardian/>

A major campaign issue included the country's [[China–Solomon Islands relations|ties with China]]; however, domestic issues were a primary concern amongst many voters, including the cost of living, the national debt and medicine shortages. Eight parties and ten independents won seats. Prime Minister Sogavare's [[Ownership, Unity and Responsibility Party]] (OUR) won the most seats, securing 15, but fell short of a majority. The opposition Coalition for Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE) bloc, made up of the [[Solomon Islands Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], [[Democratic Alliance Party (Solomon Islands)|Democratic Alliance]] and the [[Umi for Change Party]], won a combined 13 seats. Another opposition party, the [[Solomon Islands United Party|United Party]] (UP), secured six seats. 

After the election, the OUR Party established the Coalition of National Unity and Transformation with the [[Kadere Party|Kadere]] and [[People First Party (Solomon Islands)|People First]] parties. On 29 April, Sogavare announced he would not seek another term as prime minister in the 2 May parliamentary vote. The coalition nominated Foreign Minister [[Jeremiah Manele]] in his place, while CARE, UP and the [[Solomon Islands Party for Rural Advancement]] (SIPRA) selected [[Matthew Wale]]. Manele went on to defeat Wale, with the support of most of the independents.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title=China-friendly Jeremiah Manele picked as Solomon Islands PM by lawmakers|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/3261111/china-friendly-jeremiah-manele-picked-solomon-islands-pm-lawmakers?module=Australasia&pgtype=section|access-date=2 May 2024|work=South China Morning Post|archive-date=4 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240504131630/https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/3261111/china-friendly-jeremiah-manele-picked-solomon-islands-pm-lawmakers?module=Australasia&pgtype=section|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Background ==
The previous election, held in 2019, took place following amendments to the electoral act in 2018, which introduced additional measures to prevent electoral fraud, including stricter penalties for candidates and voters engaging in bribery and the implementation of a campaign blackout the day before the election to deter vote-buying.{{sfn|Wiltshire|Batley|Ridolfi|Rogers|2019|pp=40–41}} However, the maximum campaign budget for candidates saw a rapid increase from SI$50,000 to SI$500,000, resulting in cases of lavish campaign spending.{{sfn|Wiltshire|Batley|Ridolfi|Rogers|2019|pp=32–33}}
Results showed no party obtained a majority as in previous elections. Of the eight parties that secured seats, the Solomon Islands Democratic and Kadere parties emerged as the largest; both won eight. Independents won the other 21 seats.{{sfn|Wiltshire|Batley|Ridolfi|Rogers|2019|p=31}}

With no dominant party, two blocs formed to compete to take the reins of government. Manasseh Sogavare, who had previously served three non-consecutive terms as prime minister, two of which ended in no-confidence votes, refounded his [[Ownership, Unity and Responsibility Party]] (OUR) shortly after the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sogavare relaunches party amid Solomons coalition talks |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/386825/sogavare-relaunches-party-amid-solomons-coalition-talks |access-date=21 November 2023 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=11 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215000631/https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/386825/sogavare-relaunches-party-amid-solomons-coalition-talks |archive-date=15 February 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=pm>{{cite news |last1=Fanasia |first1=Andrew |title=Wale to take on Sogavare for PM's position |url=https://www.solomonstarnews.com/wale-to-take-on-sogavare-for-pm-s-position/ |access-date=21 November 2023 |work=[[Solomon Star]] |date=19 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031064718/https://www.solomonstarnews.com/wale-to-take-on-sogavare-for-pm-s-position/ |archive-date=31 October 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> The OUR Party, along with the Kadere, People First and Democratic Alliance parties, formed the Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement (DCGA) bloc<ref>{{cite news |title=New Coalition Group Formed, Claims 33 MPs |url=https://www.solomontimes.com/news/new-coalition-group-formed-claims-33-mps/8989 |access-date=21 November 2023 |work=Solomon Times |date=15 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230529111836/https://www.solomontimes.com/news/new-coalition-group-formed-claims-33-mps/8989 |archive-date=29 May 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> with Sogavare as the DCGA's nominee for prime minister.

=== 2021 unrest ===
{{Main|2021 Solomon Islands unrest}}

In November 2021, protests broke out in [[Honiara]] near parliament. Sogavare's government withdrew Solomon Islands' recognition of [[Taiwan]] in 2019 and established diplomatic ties with China. The switch faced condemnation by the opposition and the provincial government of [[Malaita Province|Malaita]], which maintained de facto relations with Taipei, increasing tensions between Sogavare and Malaita Premier [[Daniel Suidani]]. Many protesters were from Malaita province and demanded Sogavare's resignation due to the decision to pursue ties with Beijing, along with other factors, including allegations of the central government ignoring the public on issues including infrastructure. When Sogavare did not address the demonstrators, riots broke out. Police attempted to disperse the crowds by firing tear gas while the government imposed a 36-hour lockdown in the capital.<ref name=dip>{{cite news |last1=McDonald |first1=Joshua |title=Violent Protests Unsettle Solomon Islands |url=https://thediplomat.com/2021/11/violent-protests-unsettle-solomon-islands/ |access-date=26 November 2023 |work=[[The Diplomat (magazine)|The Diplomat]] |date=26 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321144308/https://thediplomat.com/2021/11/violent-protests-unsettle-solomon-islands/ |archive-date=21 March 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Demonstrators defied the curfew and took to [[Chinatown, Honiara|Honiara's Chinatown]].<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |title=Solomon Islands unrest: New Zealand to send dozens of peacekeepers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/solomon-islands-unrest-new-zealand-to-send-dozens-of-peacekeepers |access-date=26 November 2023 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923061432/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/solomon-islands-unrest-new-zealand-to-send-dozens-of-peacekeepers |archive-date=23 September 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Numerous businesses and a police station were burnt down,<ref name=dip/> resulting in three deaths. Once the rioting ceased, military personnel and police from [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] were deployed to help restore order.<ref name=guardian/> Opposition Leader Matthew Wale called for Sogavare to do "the honourable thing and resign" and announced he would file a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] if the prime minister refused. Sogavare resisted calls to step down and blamed interference from unnamed foreign powers for the riots, stating, "I don't want to name names…we know who they are".<ref name=dip/> Wale subsequently introduced a no-confidence motion, which Parliament voted on in December 2021. During the debate, Sogavare claimed the "innocent people of Malaita have been lied to by these agents of Taiwan" and described the riots as an "attempted illegal coup". Sogavare survived the no-confidence motion with 32 MPs voting to keep him in office.<ref>{{cite news |title=Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare survives vote of no confidence |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-06/solomon-islands-pm-sogavare-survives-vote-no-confidence/100676588 |access-date=26 November 2023 |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204230501/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-06/solomon-islands-pm-sogavare-survives-vote-no-confidence/100676588 |archive-date=4 February 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Security pact with China ===

In March 2022, the DCGA government signed a security pact with China, which permits Solomon Islands to request the deployment of Chinese military personnel to assist the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] in restoring order in the event of a similar incident to the [[2021 Solomon Islands unrest|2021 protests and riots]]. In such a scenario, Chinese personnel would also protect Chinese-owned businesses, nationals and diplomats.<ref name=low>{{cite news |last1=Kiloe |first1=Ilan |title=The disproportionate attention on the Solomons-China security pact |url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/disproportionate-attention-solomons-china-security-pact |access-date=29 December 2023 |work=Lowy Institute |date=11 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230902040231/https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/disproportionate-attention-solomons-china-security-pact |archive-date=2 September 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=dip2>{{cite news |last1=Zhang |first1=Denghua |last2=Pendeverana |first2=Lincy |last3=Diamana |first3=Walter |title=What Do China and Solomon Islands Get From Their Security Pact? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2022/05/what-do-china-and-solomon-islands-get-from-their-security-pact/ |access-date=29 December 2023 |work=[[The Diplomat (magazine)|The Diplomat]] |date=4 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230610224625/https://thediplomat.com/2022/05/what-do-china-and-solomon-islands-get-from-their-security-pact/ |archive-date=10 June 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> The full details of the pact were not made public.<ref name=guard2>{{cite news |last1=Piringi |first1=Charley |title=As Solomon Islands' election looms, China's influence on the Pacific country draws scrutiny |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/15/as-solomon-islands-election-looms-chinas-influence-on-the-pacific-country-draws-scrutiny?ref=upstract.com |access-date=15 April 2024 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=14 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240415031849/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/15/as-solomon-islands-election-looms-chinas-influence-on-the-pacific-country-draws-scrutiny?ref=upstract.com |archive-date=15 April 2024|url-status=live|location=[[Honiara]]}}</ref> Reportedly, a part of his "friends to all, enemy to none" foreign policy, Prime Minister Sogavare believed that the pact would benefit Solomon Islands by providing the country with more stability, which would attract more investors and result in further development. The opposition condemned the agreement, claiming it would provide more leverage for Chinese influence that would undermine Solomon Islands' democracy. They pledged to repeal it if they were to oust the DCGA government at the election. Two groups, Transparency Solomon Islands and Solomon Islands Council of Women, claimed the pact would not represent the public's interests, that it would effectively cede the country's sovereignty to China and condemned its alleged lack of holistic consultation with Solomon Islanders. Australia, Fiji, Japan, the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], New Zealand and the United States voiced concerns with the pact. These countries, along with others in the region, also feared how the agreement might allow China to establish a military base in Solomon Islands, which both Honiara and Beijing denied.<ref name=low/><ref name=dip2/> The pact prompted the United States to re-open an embassy in Honiara in 2023.<ref>{{cite news |title=US opens new embassy in Solomon Islands to counter China's increasing presence in the Pacific |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-02/us-opens-embassy-solomon-islands-china-beijing-presence-pacific/101921796 |access-date=29 December 2023 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224090117/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-02/us-opens-embassy-solomon-islands-china-beijing-presence-pacific/101921796 |archive-date=24 December 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== OUR Party ===
On 8 February, the OUR Party launched a manifesto.<ref>{{cite news |title=OUR Party to launch Manifesto |url=https://www.sibconline.com.sb/our-party-to-launch-manifesto/ |access-date=14 February 2024 |work=[[Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=7 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240208031113/https://www.sibconline.com.sb/our-party-to-launch-manifesto/ |archive-date=8 February 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> Party leader and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare announced the OUR Party's five most prioritised policies going into the election. The first was preserving social cohesion and national unity to prevent ethnic tensions from rising, as in 2000. Enhancing the nation's legal and governing systems to guarantee public safety was another key priority, as was socio-economic growth; the party pledged to utilise the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, the Solomon Islands Infrastructure Program and China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

=== Kadere Party ===

The [[Kadere Party]] focused on governance and economic transformation. General Secretary Martin Housanau announced the party would focus on shifting Solomon Islands' economy away from raw material production and into a value-adding economy as part of an industrialisation redirection. The Party also advocated for land law reform; Housanau claimed land issues were the most prominent obstacles to economic development and argued: "There are three factors of production in the economy, these are, capital, labour and land if any of these three factors is absent, the economy will become stagnant and decline".<ref name=kadere>{{cite news |last1=Dadamu |first1=Alex |last2=Hoʻatamauri |first2=George |title=Kadere Party confident ahead of April Election |url=https://www.sibconline.com.sb/kadere-party-confident-ahead-of-april-election/ |access-date=11 April 2024 |work=[[Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240301235833/https://www.sibconline.com.sb/kadere-party-confident-ahead-of-april-election/ |archive-date=1 March 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Allegations of foreign interference==
A week before the election, Russia's state-owned [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] news agency published an article featuring anonymous claims that the United States and [[USAID]] were planning an "electoral coup" in Solomon Islands, which were repeated by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] newspaper ''[[Global Times]]''.

In September 2022, the Australian government proposed to assist in funding the general elections. The DCGA government initially criticised the offer and accused the Australian government of foreign interference, alleging they disclosed the offer occurred when parliament debated delaying the general election to influence the opposition. Opposition MP [[Peter Kenilorea Jr.]] denounced the DCGA government's response as "extremely unhelpful" and claimed it was evidence of Sogavare attempting to hold onto power.
