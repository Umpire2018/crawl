==Electoral system==
South Africa has a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary system of government]]. The [[president of South Africa]] is unusual among [[Head of state|heads of state]] of countries with a parliamentary system in that the [[head of government]], who holds executive powers, is titled president and also plays the ceremonial role of [[head of state]].

In June 2020, the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] ruled in ''[[New Nation Movement NPC v President of the Republic of South Africa]]'' that the [[Electoral Act, 1998|Electoral Act]] was unconstitutional to the extent that it did not allow independents to contest national and provincial elections.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mabuza |first=Ernest |date=11 June 2020 |title=Constitutional Court judgment opens door for independent candidates to stand for election |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-06-11-concourt-ruling-opens-door-for-independent-candidates-to-stand-for-election-in-sa/ |access-date=7 July 2021 |work=[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]|archive-date=9 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709183738/https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-06-11-concourt-ruling-opens-door-for-independent-candidates-to-stand-for-election-in-sa/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the first elections held under [[universal suffrage]], 400 members elected were elected to the National Assembly by a system of [[proportional representation]] with a [[closed list]] approach. Two hundred members were elected from national party lists, while the other 200 were elected from provincial party lists in each of the [[Provinces of South Africa|nine provinces]]. The national list seats were awarded by subtracting seats won at the provincial level from each party's national allocation to generate a maximally proportional result. The [[Droop quota]] variant of the [[largest remainder method]] was used to allocate seats at both the national and provincial levels.<ref name="electionguide">{{Cite web |title=Election for National Assembly |url=http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2721/ |access-date=4 January 2020 |website=IFES Election Guide |archive-date=29 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211847/http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2721/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Provincial legislatures were also elected by a system of proportional representation with closed party lists.

=== Regional ballot ===
The regional ballot is one of the two ballots used in South Africa's national elections, alongside the national ballot. Voters were also presented with a third ballot, a single ballot used for the election of members of the nine provincial legislatures, held on the same day. The regional ballot is used to elect representatives to the National Assembly from each of the country's nine provinces. The regional ballot is proportional, meaning that seats are allocated to parties and independent candidates based on the number of votes received.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2024 General Elections, 29 May |url=https://www.gov.za/news/elections2024 |access-date=13 May 2024 |website=gov.za |archive-date=13 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513205340/https://www.gov.za/news/elections2024 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Election of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures ===
On 17 April 2023, president [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] signed the [[South African Electoral Amendment Bill]] into law allowing independent candidates to stand for election to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures while keeping proportional representation with closed lists. Two hundred members will be elected from national party lists, while the remaining 200 seats will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces. In provincial legislatures, the single-tier multimember proportional system will continue to apply, with political parties and independent candidates contesting for seats. Voters will receive three ballot papers as opposed to two in previous elections; the first ballot will be to elect the 200 members of the National Assembly only contested by political parties; the second ballot will be to elect the remaining 200 members of the National Assembly, which will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces; and the third ballot will be to elect members of the provincial legislatures with political parties and independent candidates as well.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What's new in the 2024 Elections? |url=https://www.elections.org.za/pw/elections/whats-new-in-the-2024-elections-electoral-amendment-act |access-date=18 October 2023 |website=Electoral Commission of South Africa |archive-date=19 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231019153453/https://www.elections.org.za/pw/elections/whats-new-in-the-2024-elections-electoral-amendment-act |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 15 May 2024, two weeks before the election, president Ramaphosa signed the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act into law, establishing a [[National Health Insurance (South Africa)|National Health Insurance]] state fund to provide more South Africans access to private healthcare.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 May 2024 |title=A new South Africa health law aims at deep inequality, but critics say they'll challenge it |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-health-law-elections-e1e15892eaa6efa51cc1bf14959d3453 |access-date=19 May 2024 |website=AP News|archive-date=19 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240519030656/https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-health-law-elections-e1e15892eaa6efa51cc1bf14959d3453 |url-status=live }}</ref> The goal of the bill is to eventually phase out the use of private healthcare, replacing it with the NHI as the sole purchaser and provider of health insurance.

The EFF shares a similar stance to that of the ANC. In their manifesto, the EFF outlines seven pillars on which they are basing their policies.

The DA opposes the policy of expropriation without compensation and sees attempts at expropriation as violating section 25 of the Constitution.

The parties have taken varying stances on the issue. The ANC has pledged to create 12.5 million new jobs, a large portion of which will be devoted to a clean energy transition and modernisation of the nation's electrical system. The ANC has also linked the blackouts and energy crisis to environmental justice and climate change, claiming that its energy transition platform is also part of a larger transition to a cleaner economy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 February 2024 |title=South Africa's ANC launches election manifesto as president highlights party's achievements |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-elections-anc-manifesto-jobs-646a45300a06f720fae842f5c1cad56b |access-date=18 April 2024 |website=AP News|archive-date=13 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513151041/https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-elections-anc-manifesto-jobs-646a45300a06f720fae842f5c1cad56b |url-status=live }}</ref> According to the ANC's election manifesto, the party pledges to "cultivate partnerships to expand domestic industries with significant potential to create sustainable jobs... such as energy."<ref name=":02" /> Additionally, the party views a clean energy transition as essential in solving the energy crisis.

The DA largely blames the ANC for the energy crisis, saying that the state uses an "outdated" model of control and regulation. The DA intends to reduce government control over the energy sector if it is able to form a government. Using the [[Western Cape]] as a case study, the DA says it has a successful platform for energy solutions. They argue that recent contracts to build new solar plants in the area are indicative of this.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024 |title=The DA's Rescue Plan For South Africa |url=https://cdn.da.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/16143750/DA-Election-Manifesto-2024.pdf |access-date=18 April 2024 |website=DA Election Manifesto |archive-date=19 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419012148/http://cdn.da.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/16143750/DA-Election-Manifesto-2024.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of their energy platform has to do with deregulation and reducing taxes on private entities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What has the DA been doing to fix the electricity crisis? |url=https://www.da.org.za/fixing-the-electricity-crisis |access-date=30 April 2024 |website=Democratic Alliance|archive-date=1 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000615/https://www.da.org.za/fixing-the-electricity-crisis |url-status=live }}</ref>

The EFF takes a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] approach to the issue. The party calls for the end of the privatization of Eskom, while calling for the involvement of the private sector in new electricity generation as part of efforts to shift control to the "majority of black people."<ref name=":13" />

=== Cadre deployment ===
The ANC has practised a policy of employing people who are loyal to the ANC to positions within institutions of government. The [[Zondo Commission]] has found that cadre deployment played a significant part in corruption and went as far as to say that it is "illegal and unconstitutional".<ref>{{Cite web |title='Cadre deployment is illegal' – Zondo |url=https://www.news24.com/citypress/politics/cadre-deployment-is-illegal-zondo-20220625 |access-date=23 February 2024 |website=City Press|archive-date=23 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240223173949/https://www.news24.com/citypress/politics/cadre-deployment-is-illegal-zondo-20220625 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Gauteng]] is the most populated province and is the ''de facto'' economic hub of South Africa. In 2019 the ANC had barely retained the province, getting 50.19% of the vote.

The ANC lost its majority in Gauteng, claiming under 35% of the vote, followed by the DA with just over 28%.

=== KwaZulu-Natal ===
[[KwaZulu-Natal]] is the second most populated province and is home to the [[Durban|busiest port]] in southern Africa. Recent polling has the new [[MK Party]] leading in the province, having grown substantially at the expense of ANC support.

DA leader [[John Steenhuisen]] described the video as "the most successful political advertisement in our democratic history," saying that it was seen by at least four million people online and heard by "millions more" in other media.

While counting was ongoing, the ANC said that its leadership would meet on 31 May to "reflect on what is good for the country." The DA's [[John Steenhuisen]] said that the results showed that South Africa was "heading into coalition country" and expressed a willingness to work alongside the ANC, adding that he would have to first consult with other signatories of the Multi-Party Charter.<ref>{{Cite news |date=31 May 2024 |title=South Africa heads for 'coalition country' as partial election results put ruling ANC well below 50% |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-anc-0799ce0d04399fdf594aa8a7ac7914e3 |access-date=31 May 2024 |work=[[Associated Press]]|archive-date=31 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240531084810/https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-anc-0799ce0d04399fdf594aa8a7ac7914e3 |url-status=live }}</ref> The DA also said that a government composed of the ANC, the MK, and the EFF would be a "doomsday coalition" pursuing previous policy failures in the country. The EFF's [[Julius Malema]] said that the election results marked the end of the ANC's "entitlement of being the sole dominant party", adding that he was open to talks with the ANC on forming a coalition government. The Patriotic Alliance's [[Gayton McKenzie]] compared prospects of an ANC-DA coalition to "a marriage of two drunk people in Las Vegas" that would prove "unworkable".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 June 2024 |title=The ANC party that freed South Africa from apartheid loses its 30-year majority in landmark election |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-anc-d9da7582ca98a4e00fec2da6a5fe1e91 |access-date=2 June 2024 |website=Associated Press|archive-date=2 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240602034552/https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-anc-d9da7582ca98a4e00fec2da6a5fe1e91 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the same day, the ANC, the DA, the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) and the [[Patriotic Alliance]] (PA), agreed to form a national unity government, with [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] being re-elected [[President of South Africa]].<ref name="ancda2">{{cite news |last1=Chothia |first1=Farouk |last2=Kupemba |first2=Danai Kesta |last3=Plett-Usher |first3=Barbra |date=14 June 2024 |title=ANC and DA agree on South Africa unity government |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8007w4vqveo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240614112052/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8007w4vqveo |archive-date=14 June 2024 |access-date=14 June 2024 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="ramaphosare-elected2">{{cite news |date=14 June 2024 |title=South Africa's National Assembly re-elects Cyril Ramaphosa as president |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-national-assembly-re-elects-cyril-ramaphosa-president-2024-06-14/ |access-date=14 June 2024 |work=Reuters}}</ref> He was sworn in as president on 19 June while negotiations on the cabinet were ongoing. 

In an interview on [[SABC News]]' ''Face the Nation'' current affairs programme, DA Federal Council Chairperson [[Helen Zille]] said in reference to the Patriotic Alliance admission: "So you can't just let anybody come in without consulting with us and then he makes the appointments in consultation with the leaders of the parties who have been accepted for admission".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maromo |first=Jonisayi |date=19 June 2024 |title=Patriotic Alliance: Helen Zille thinks she is in charge of the government of national unity |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/patriotic-alliance-helen-zille-thinks-she-is-in-charge-of-the-government-of-national-unity-f249576f-b76c-4621-971b-cf711bdeb237 |access-date=19 June 2024 |website=IOL News}}</ref> Zille specifically referred to Clause 17 of the Statement of Intent, which governs the President's powers in appointing an Executive.

Other parties to join the national unity government are [[Good (political party)|GOOD]], shortly after the first sitting of parliament, the [[Pan Africanist Congress|PAC]], on the 19th, and the [[FF+]] on the 20th of June. The [[United Democratic Movement|UDM]] decided to join on the 21st, [[Rise Mzansi]] on the 22nd, [[Al Jama-ah]] on the 23rd, and [[United Africans Transformation|UAT]] on the 30th of June 2024.<ref name="President30June2024">{{cite web |date=30 June 2024 |title=Statement by President Cyril Ramaphosa on the appointment of members of the national executive |url=https://www.presidency.gov.za/statement-president-cyril-ramaphosa-appointment-members-national-executive |access-date=7 July 2024}}</ref><ref name="President30June2024YouTube">{{cite web |date=30 June 2024 |title=President Ramaphosa Announces South African New Government: GNU, A Historic Unity of 11 Parties! |website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTTYtynxGY8 |access-date=30 June 2024}}</ref> This brought the GNU to [[Cabinet of South Africa#Current cabinet|288 seats]] in the 400 seat parliament (72%).

The DA reportedly requested 10 posts in the cabinet, including the ministries of Communication and digital technology, Trade and industry, Transport, Public service and administration, Water and sanitation, Local government and Health, as well as deputy minister posts of finance and health. In addition, the DA requested that [[John Steenhuisen]] be designated as deputy president over ANC incumbent [[Paul Mashatile]]. The ANC rejected most of the requests on the grounds of multiple other parties joining the coalition negotiations, instead agreeing to up to five cabinet positions for the DA. The DA's negotiators, including Steenhuisen and [[Tony Leon]], considered withdrawing, but instead agreed to keep negotiations open with the ANC.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Patel |first=Faizel |date=2024-06-23 |title=DA 'wants Steenhuisen as deputy president' in GNU |url=https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/politics/da-steenhuisen-deputy-president-gnu-ramaphosa-cabinet-latest/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=The Citizen |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Staff Reporter |date=June 23, 2024 |title=Breaking News: ANC issues deadline to DA for new cabinet proposals amid deadlock |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/breaking-news-anc-issues-deadline-to-da-for-new-cabinet-proposals-amid-deadlock-d64241a9-6998-4643-b1e7-cb1aab56b0de |work=[[Independent Online]]}}</ref>

On 30 June, Ramaphosa unveiled his new 32-member cabinet, with the ANC holding 20 posts, the DA holding six, and the remainder being held by other coalition members. John Steenhuisen was appointed as agriculture minister, while the leaders of four other parties were also named ministers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-coalition-cabinet-president-757b0f886812371085699c957ae1607a |title=South African parties agree on Cabinet positions, sealing deal on new coalition government |access-date=1 July 2024 |work=Associated Press}}</ref> In addition, 42 deputy ministers were named from among the coalition parties.
