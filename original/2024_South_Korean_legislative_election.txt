Legislative elections were held in [[South Korea]] on 10 April 2024. All 300 members of the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] were elected, 254 from [[first-past-the-post]] [[South Korean Legislature Constituencies|constituencies]] and 46 from [[party-list proportional representation|proportional party lists]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 February 2024 |title=Political parties in full-fledged election mode as April 10 voting nears |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/05/113_369101.html |access-date=29 February 2024 |website=[[The Korea Times]] |language=en |archive-date=29 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229214704/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=369101 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=선거일정 |url=https://www.nec.go.kr/site/nec/ex/bbs/View.do?cbIdx=1104&bcIdx=192949 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125194511/https://www.nec.go.kr/site/nec/ex/bbs/View.do?cbIdx=1104&bcIdx=192949 |archive-date=25 November 2023 |access-date=25 November 2023 |website=National Electoral Commission}}</ref> The two largest parties, the liberal [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2015)|Democratic Party]] and the conservative [[People Power Party (South Korea)|People Power Party]], once again set up [[Bloc party#South Korea|satellite parties]] to take advantage of the electoral system.

The election served as a "mid-term evaluation" for the administration of President [[Yoon Suk-yeol]] as it approached its third year. Additionally, there was significant interest in whether the ruling party could surpass the constraints of the ruling coalition, which did not secure a majority in the previous general election, and gain the necessary momentum to govern effectively during the remainder of its term.<ref>{{Cite web |last=김 |first=연정 |date=2024-04-11 |title=[4·10 총선] 또 무너진 與…野 협조 없이 입법·예산 불가능 |url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240410039700001 |access-date=2024-04-21 |website=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |language=ko}}</ref>

===Redistricting===
On 28 February 2024, the ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus to redraw the electoral districts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=안 |first=윤학 |date=2024-02-29 |title=[속보] 여야, 선거구획정 극적 합의..."오늘 본회의서 처리" |url=https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0101_202402291206004957 |access-date=2024-04-21 |website=[[YTN]] |language=ko}}</ref> Subsequently, the National Assembly's plenary session passed an amendment to the Public Offices Election Act, resulting in the reformation of the electoral districts. In comparison to the 21st National Assembly elections, there was an increase of one constituency, bringing the total to 254, while the seats for proportional representation decreased by one, totaling 46.<ref>{{Cite web |last=김 |first=연정 |date=2024-02-29 |title=4·10총선 선거구 획정안 국회 통과…전북 대신 비례 1석 축소 |url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240229146100001 |access-date=2024-04-21 |website=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |language=ko}}</ref>

==Campaign==
The election was held amid several political and socioeconomic issues in South Korea such as corruption, with President [[Yoon Suk-yeol]] of the [[People Power Party (South Korea)|People Power Party]] facing criticism over the handling of issues involving [[Kim Keon-hee|his wife]] and a [[Lee Jong-sup|former minister]], and party leaders such as the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2015)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Lee Jae-myung]] and [[Rebuilding Korea Party]]'s [[Cho Kuk]] facing trials for bribery and forgery respectively,<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 April 2024 |title=South Korea holds parliamentary elections: All you need to know |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/9/south-korea-holds-parliamentary-elections-all-you-need-to-know |access-date=10 April 2024 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en |archive-date=9 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240409224655/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/9/south-korea-holds-parliamentary-elections-all-you-need-to-know |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as rising inflation and the ongoing [[2024 South Korean medical crisis|medical crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 April 2024 |title=South Korea election issues: Green onions, striking doctors, an alleged sexist jab at a candidate |url=https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-parliamentary-elections-8ac15e82dacaff19f3c54197fe6d9b9b |access-date=5 April 2024 |website=Associated Press |language=en |author1=Kim, Hyung-Jim |author2=Tong-Hyung, Kim |archive-date=5 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240405043259/https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-parliamentary-elections-8ac15e82dacaff19f3c54197fe6d9b9b |url-status=live }}</ref> One major talking point was an incident on 18 March when President Yoon visited a grocery store in [[Seoul]] to check consumer prices and describing the 875-won ($0.65) price of a [[green onion]] he found as reasonable, only for it to emerge that the onions were being sold at a discount and that the true price of onions was three to four times higher. The incident led to opposition candidates bringing out green onions at campaign rallies and the hashtag #greenonions875won becoming a trending topic on social media throughout the election. In response, the [[National Election Commission (South Korea)|National Election Commission]] banned voters from bringing green onions to polling stations, citing concerns over "election interference". This was in turn, widely ridiculed and led to an increase in demand for green onion-themed merchandise.<ref name="onion">{{Cite web |date=7 April 2024 |title=Green onion outcry: humble vegetable roils S.

Throughout the campaign the People Power Party argued that President Yoon's government has been unable to push its reform agenda forward since taking office in 2022 due to an uncooperative [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] controlled by the opposition, while the Democratic Party described Yoon's administration as "incompetent", accusing it of causing a socioeconomic downturn and mishandling several controversial issues.
