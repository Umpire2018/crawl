==Background==
===Political landscape before the election===
The [[Sri Lanka People's Freedom Alliance]] (SLPFA), led by [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], won a large majority in the [[2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election]] on 5 August 2020.<ref name="EC-07.06.2020" /> During their tenure, the government under President [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]] and [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] Mahinda Rajapaksa faced multiple crises, including the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka|COVID-19 pandemic]] and an [[Sri Lankan economic crisis (2019–present)|economic crisis]], which culminated into widespread [[2022 Sri Lankan protests|protests]] and the [[2022 Sri Lankan political crisis]].<ref name="AJ-10.04.2022">{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/10/thousands-in-sri-lanka-insist-rajapaksa-family-quit-politics |title=Thousands in Sri Lanka insist Rajapaksa family quit politics |publisher=Al Jazeera |last1=Rasheed |first1=Zaheena |last2=Kuruwita |first2=Rathindra |date=22 April 2022 |access-date=16 October 2024 |archive-date=12 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240912200042/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/10/thousands-in-sri-lanka-insist-rajapaksa-family-quit-politics |url-status=live}}</ref>

As per the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981, although the Sri Lankan parliament has a term of five years, the president can dissolve it after two years and six months from its first meeting or upon receiving a resolution from parliament.

==Electoral system==
{{See also|Elections in Sri Lanka|List of parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka}}

The [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] has 225 members elected for a five-year term. 196 members are elected from 22 multi-seat [[Electoral districts in Sri Lanka|constituencies]] through an [[open list]] [[proportional representation]] system with a 5% electoral threshold; voters can rank up to three candidates on the party list they vote for.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.lk/en/members-of-parliament/the-system-of-elections-in-sri-lanka/the-electoral-system |title=The Electoral System |publisher=The Parliament of Sri Lanka |date=14 December 2012 |access-date=6 September 2024 |archive-date=6 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240906145309/https://www.parliament.lk/en/members-of-parliament/the-system-of-elections-in-sri-lanka/the-electoral-system |url-status=live}}</ref> The other 29 seats are elected from a national list, with list members appointed by party secretaries and seats allocated according to the island-wide proportional vote the party obtains.

Every proclamation dissolving parliament must be published in ''[[The Sri Lanka Gazette]]'' and must specify the nomination period and the date of the election. The first meeting of the new parliament must occur within three months of the previous parliament's dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.lk/files/pdf/constitution.pdf |title=The Constitution of the D.

=== Rejection of nomination papers ===
YouTuber Ashen Senarathna announced his candidacy for the Sri Lankan Parliament, seeking to represent the Colombo electoral district as part of an independent group. On 11 October 2024, the Election Commission rejected his nomination, citing that it was submitted by an unauthorised individual, which led to disqualification. Senarathna plans to take legal action, claiming he was asked to wait outside while another candidate submitted the nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newswire.lk/2024/10/11/wrong-person-handing-over-youtuber-ashens-nomination-rejected/ |title=Wrong person handing over : YouTuber Ashen's nomination rejected |publisher=Newswire |date=11 October 2024 |access-date=14 October 2024}}</ref>

== Results ==
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's [[National People's Power]] alliance won 159 of the 225 seats, securing a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.

Reports suggest that Dissanayake's campaign focused on anti-corruption, social welfare, and economic revival amidst the [[Sri Lankan economic crisis (2019–present)|country's economic crisis]] resonated with voters.<ref name="NYT-15Nov-SLL">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/asia/sri-lanka-election.html |title=Sri Lankan Leader's Leftist Coalition Wins Elections |work=The New York Times |last=Warawita |first=Pamodi |date=15 November 2024 |accessdate=20 November 2024 |archive-date=20 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241120012921/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/asia/sri-lanka-election.html |url-status=}}</ref><ref name="APN-15Nov-PSL">{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-dissanayake-parliament-a57fb69161d49ebeac77d73568599a4e |title=Party of Sri Lanka's new Marxist-leaning president wins two-thirds majority in parliament |publisher=AP News |last1=Francis |first1=Krishan |last2=Mallawarachi |first2=Bharatha |date=15 November 2024 |accessdate=20 November 2024 |archive-date=18 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241118132734/https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-dissanayake-parliament-a57fb69161d49ebeac77d73568599a4e |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="TH-16Nov-ARV">{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-resounding-victory-on-the-sri-lankan-election-result/article68872482.ece |title=A resounding victory: On the Sri Lankan election result |work=The Hindu |date=16 November 2024 |accessdate=20 November 2024 |archive-date=16 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241116195100/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-resounding-victory-on-the-sri-lankan-election-result/article68872482.ece |url-status=live}}</ref>
