== Electoral system ==
{{Further|List of presidential elections in Sri Lanka}}

=== Type of electoral system ===
The President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited [[ranked voting]]. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.gov.lk/web/wp-content/uploads/publication/acts/15-1981_E.pdf |title=Presidential Elections Act, No.15 of 1981 |publisher=Election Commission of Sri Lanka |date= |accessdate=24 August 2024 |archive-date=3 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240803060705/https://elections.gov.lk/web/wp-content/uploads/publication/acts/15-1981_E.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> 

In practice, this system had seen no use. Every presidential election since the first in [[1982 Sri Lankan presidential election|1982]] had resulted in a candidate from one of the major parties or alliances winning an outright majority in the first count. Consequently, most voters choose to mark only one candidate on their ballots, and many are either unaware that they can rank multiple candidates or choose not to exercise that prerogative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anfrel.org/final-mission-report-2019-sri-lankan-presidential-election/ |title=Final Mission Report: 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election |publisher=Asian Network for Free Elections |date=31 January 2020 |accessdate=24 August 2024 |archive-date=3 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303154730/https://anfrel.org/final-mission-report-2019-sri-lankan-presidential-election/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cmev.org/2020/06/17/cmev-election-observation-report-presidential-election-2019/ |title=CMEV Election Observation Report – Presidential Election 2019 |publisher=Centre for Monitoring Election Violence |date=17 June 2020 |accessdate=24 August 2024 |archive-date=27 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927014858/https://cmev.org/2020/06/17/cmev-election-observation-report-presidential-election-2019/#content |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Election Commission outlined the voting procedure on 30 August 2024, detailing the ranked voting system due to the multiple candidates contesting the presidential election, ensuring voters were informed on how to cast and submit their ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.gov.lk/web/wp-content/uploads/media-release/2024/MR_PRE_2024_56_STE.pdf |title=Presidential Election 2024 – Procedure to vote |publisher=Election Commission of Sri Lanka |date=30 August 2024 |accessdate=30 August 2024 |archive-date=30 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240830164509/https://elections.gov.lk/web/wp-content/uploads/media-release/2024/MR_PRE_2024_56_STE.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fernandopulle |first1=Sherain |title=How to vote in 2024 Presidential Election |url=https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story/How-to-vote-in-2024-Presidential-Election/155-290715 |access-date=31 August 2024 |work=[[Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|Daily Mirror]] |date=31 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240831060328/https://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story/How-to-vote-in-2024-Presidential-Election/155-290715 |archive-date=31 August 2024 |language=English}}</ref> Voting began at 13,134 polling stations nationwide at 7:00 AM [[Sri Lanka Standard Time|SLST]] on 21 September and closed at 4:00 PM SLST.<ref name="ajstake">{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/20/sri-lanka-election-2024-who-could-be-the-next-president-whats-at-stake |title=Sri Lanka election 2024: Who could be the next president, what's at stake? |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=20 September 2024 |accessdate=20 September 2024 |archive-date=21 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240921040736/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/20/sri-lanka-election-2024-who-could-be-the-next-president-whats-at-stake |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Ballot boxes and security systems ===
Due to the larger size of the ballot papers, the Election Commission has opted to use cardboard ballot boxes instead of traditional wooden ones. These boxes will be available in three sizes. A combination of wooden and cardboard ballot boxes was used in the [[2019 Sri Lankan presidential election]] and the [[2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Cardboard-ballot-boxes-instead-of-wooden-boxes-this-time/108-290190 |title=Cardboard ballot boxes, instead of wooden boxes, this time |publisher=Daily Mirror |last=Bandara |first=Kelum |date=24 August 2024 |accessdate=24 August 2024 |archive-date=24 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240824100806/https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Cardboard-ballot-boxes-instead-of-wooden-boxes-this-time/108-290190 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102030/ec-issues-statement-regarding-ballot-boxes-for-presidential-election |title=EC issues statement regarding ballot boxes for Presidential Election |publisher=Ada Derana |date=17 September 2024 |accessdate=17 September 2024 |archive-date=17 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240917072758/https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=102030 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

To further ensure security, the government imposed a liquor ban on the weekend of 21 to 22 September and deployed more than 63,000 police officers to secure polling stations and counting centres. It also banned the holding of victory rallies or celebrations until a week after the results were announced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240921-sri-lanka-votes-in-first-poll-since-economic-collapse |title=Polls close in first Sri Lanka election since economic collapse |publisher=France 24 |date=21 September 2024 |accessdate=21 September 2024 |archive-date=21 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240921135050/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240921-sri-lanka-votes-in-first-poll-since-economic-collapse |url-status=live }}</ref> A nighttime curfew was also declared after the end of voting, which was lifted at noon on 22 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznjz3d78o |title=Sri Lanka election goes to historic second count |publisher=BBC |date=22 September 2024 |accessdate=22 September 2024 |archive-date=22 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240922034942/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznjz3d78o |url-status=live }}</ref>

One of the main reasons for the proliferation of candidates is the low [[election deposit]] required to contest – Rs. 50,000 (US$170) for party candidates and Rs. 75,000 (US$250) for independent candidates. These amounts that have remained unchanged since the introduction of presidential elections in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymirror.lk/print/front-page/Majority-of-candidates-enter-Prez-poll-for-petty-personal-gains-independent-monitors/238-289302 |title=Majority of candidates enter Prez poll for petty personal gains – independent monitors |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=12 August 2024 |accessdate=26 August 2024 |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816140431/https://www.dailymirror.lk/print/front-page/Majority-of-candidates-enter-Prez-poll-for-petty-personal-gains-independent-monitors/238-289302 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sundaytimes.lk/online/latest-news/acting-now-to-stop-dummy-candidates/18-1112075 |title=Acting now to stop dummy candidates |publisher=The Sunday Times |last=Jayawardana |first=Sandun |date=12 December 2019 |accessdate=26 August 2024 |archive-date=26 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240826150722/https://sundaytimes.lk/online/latest-news/acting-now-to-stop-dummy-candidates/18-1112075 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The following nationwide presidential poll was conducted by the IHP. The poll ranked Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and a generic SLPP candidate.

As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100 – Undecided Percentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types of data they provide.}}-->

As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100 – Undecided Percentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types of data they provide.}}-->
