According to Abu Hassan al-Hamwi, head of HTS's military wing, the offensive had been planned for a year prior to its launch. Beginning in 2019, HTS developed a military doctrine aimed at transforming loosely organized opposition and jihadist fighters into a conventional military force. The group established specialized military branches, most notably a drone unit that produced reconnaissance, attack, and suicide drones. HTS additionally established coordination with southern Syrian rebels, creating a unified command structure that incorporated leaders from approximately 25 rebel groups, with the strategic objective of encircling Damascus from multiple directions.<ref name="guardian-plot">{{cite news |last=Christou |first=William |date=13 December 2024 |title=Syrian rebels reveal year-long plot that brought down Assad regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/syrian-rebels-reveal-year-long-plot-that-brought-down-assad-regime |work=The Guardian}}</ref> HTS initiated the offensive partly to disrupt regional powers' diplomatic normalization with the Assad regime and to counter escalating aerial attacks on northwestern Syria. The group determined that Assad's international allies were strategically constrained, with Russia committed to its war in Ukraine and both Iran and Hezbollah engaged in conflict with Israel, presenting a favorable tactical opportunity.<ref name="guardian-plot"/>

The [[Main Directorate of Intelligence (Ukraine)|Ukrainian HUR]] is also alleged to have dispatched advisors to the rebels to coordinate this offensive<ref name="KP"/> as well as intelligence and material support to opposition forces including HTS.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Soylu |first=Ragip |date=2 December 2024 |title=Has Ukraine helped the Syrian rebel offensive in Aleppo? |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/has-ukraine-helped-syrian-rebel-offensive-aleppo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241202193210/https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/has-ukraine-helped-syrian-rebel-offensive-aleppo |archive-date=2 December 2024 |work=Middle East Eye}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=4 December 2024 |title=Ukrainian intelligence coordinating with Syrian rebels against 'mutual enemy', says opposition figure |url=https://www.newarab.com/news/ukraine-intelligence-may-be-coordinating-syrian-rebels |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241204184206/https://www.newarab.com/news/ukraine-intelligence-may-be-coordinating-syrian-rebels |archive-date=4 December 2024 |work=The New Arab}}</ref>

[[Hezbollah]], which was a "major ally" of the Syrian government during the [[Syrian civil war|civil war]], was severely weakened during its [[Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)|war with Israel]] since October 2023. The deaths of [[Hassan Nasrallah]] and much of its military leadership, combined with the redeployment of Hezbollah fighters in Syria back to Lebanon, left a large power vacuum. With the Russian military concentrating on its [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]] and [[Iran]] under significant pressure, it provided an opportunity for rebel groups to launch an offensive.<ref name="cnn 28-11">{{Cite web |last=Salem |first=Mostafa |date=28 November 2024 |title=Syria's rebels exploit weaknesses in Iran's proxies to launch surprise offensive |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/syria-rebels-government-iran-analysis-intl/index.html |access-date=28 November 2024 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

According to Nick Heras, an analyst with the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, the rebels were trying to pre-empt a Syrian government offensive which was being shaped by Russian and Syrian airstrikes on rebel areas. The presence of Turkish-backed groups in the offensive was believed to be a warning from Turkey to Russia and the Syrian government to avoid any offensives in the region.<ref>{{cite news |title=Syrian insurgents cut off key road as 200 die in escalating violence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/syrian-insurgents-cut-damascus-aleppo-highway-amid-fresh-offensive |access-date=29 November 2024 |work=The Guardian |date=28 November 2024 }}</ref>

Prior to the fall of the Assad government, the [[Institute for the Study of War]] (ISW) assessed that if this were to occur, it would damage the global perception of Russia as an effective partner and protector which together with the loss of bases in Syria which are the primary logistical hubs for shipments from Russia sent to Libya and eventually sub-Saharan Africa would undermine Russia's goals of expanding its influence in Africa. [[Tartus naval base|Tartus base]] is Russia's only formal overseas naval base and links Russia's Black Sea assets to the Mediterranean and is central for future expansion plans in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, which would threaten NATO's southern flank. The ISW analysed that the [[Africa Corps (Russia)|Africa Corps]], while the easiest to deploy to Syria, lacks the numbers to make a difference and its limited forces are already overstretched across Africa or recalled to fight in Kursk to repel the [[2024 Kursk offensive|Ukrainian incursion into Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Africa File Special Edition: Syria's Potential Impact on Russia's Africa and Mediterranean Ambitions |url=https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/africa-file-special-edition-syria%E2%80%99s-potential-impact-russia%E2%80%99s-africa-and-mediterranean |website=Institute for the Study of War |access-date=5 December 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

According to analysts, Syrian government defeats can largely be attributed to its confidence in an ultimate victory over the rebels and the lack of effort it has put in strengthening its military ranks over the four years since the [[Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019 – March 2020)|Idlib ceasefire in 2020]]. Pointing to the prevalence of unwilling and poorly paid young conscripts in the army, observers noted that Iran would be hesitant to provide Assad with needed ground support.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Abdulrahim |first=Raja |date=7 December 2024 |title=Syria Live Updates: Assad did little to support the military ranks, analysts say. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus/assad-did-little-to-support-the-military-ranks-analysts-say?smid=url-share |access-date=7 December 2024 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Analysts have also said that Russia sees little purpose to intervene more forcefully against the rebels, beyond some limited airstrikes, given the perceived ineffectiveness of Assad's forces.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Troianovski |first=Anton |date=7 December 2024 |title=Syria Live Updates: Russia, an Assad ally, is unlikely to come to his aid. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus/russia-an-assad-ally-is-unlikely-to-come-to-his-aid?smid=url-share |access-date=7 December 2024 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Russian analysts generally blamed al-Assad for losing the war. Speaking to ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', [[Semyon Bagdasarov]] argued that the Syrian government failed to motivate its troops and to unite the various Syrian ethnic and religious groups around its cause.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Baranov |first=Andrey |date=8 December 2024 |title=The Syrian cauldron could not withstand the pressure and exploded: What will happen next |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/27670.5/5021691/ |work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |language=ru}}</ref> Similarly, political scientist Andrey Kortunov wrote that al-Assad had failed to unite Syrians and achieve national reconciliation, comparing him to former Afghan president [[Ashraf Ghani]], who [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|was overthrown by the Taliban]] in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kortunov |first=Andrey |date=9 December 2024 |title=In Syria, everything is just beginning |url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7362127?from=author_1 |access-date= |website=[[Kommersant]] |language=ru}}</ref> Journalist Vitaly Ryumshin shared this comparison, but partially defended the Syrian government, arguing that the lack of reform was due to economic sanctions on the country and loss of control over the oil's resources to the United States and the Kurds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vitaly |first=Ryumshin |date=9 December 2024 |title=What will happen to Syria after Assad? |url=https://www.gazeta.ru/comments/column/articles/20209946.shtml |access-date= |website=[[Gazeta.Ru]] |language=ru}}</ref> In a different view, Anton Mardasov, a Russian expert on the Middle East, told ''[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]'' that the government's collapse was not due to Western sanctions but because of al-Assad's failure in dealing with the country's problems, specifically mentioning the economic crisis, endemic corruption and nepotism and "the loss of touch with reality and thinking in the paradigm of 50 years ago".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Subbotin |first1=Igor |last2=Petrov |first2=Gennady |date=8 December 2024 |title=The fall of Damascus Assad |url=https://www.ng.ru/world/2024-12-08/1_9151_syria.html |access-date= |website=[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]] |language=ru}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', the collapse of the Assad regime carries repercussions for both Russia and Iran due to their investment on the survival of the regime; Iran's [[Axis of Resistance]] had effectively collapsed with the loss of Assad's rule in Syria, undermining Iran's ability to supply [[Hezbollah]], while Russia's invasion of Ukraine distracted Putin from Syria and exposed his struggle to keep supporting Russia's allies in Latin America and Africa (in particular Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Collins |first1=Tim |date=8 December 2024 |title=The fall of Assad is a disaster for Putin.
