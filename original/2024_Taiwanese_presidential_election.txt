The opposition [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) nominated the incumbent [[New Taipei City|New Taipei]] mayor [[Hou Yu-ih]] as their candidate for president in May 2023. In November, Hou chose the former [[Legislative Yuan]] member [[Jaw Shaw-kong]] to be his running mate. The [[Taiwan People's Party]] (TPP) nominated [[Ko Wen-je]], its leader and a former Mayor of [[Taipei]], who in turn chose [[Legislative Yuan]] member [[Cynthia Wu]] as his running mate. Despite previously saying he would support Hou's nomination, businessman [[Terry Gou]] declared his own independent bid in September 2023, before ultimately dropping out in November. Although the KMT and the TPP had initially agreed to field a joint ticket in November 2023, the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement, and each announced their own vice presidential candidate on the last day of registration.

This presidential election had a [[voter turnout|turnout]] of 71.86%, which was 3.04% lower than that of the [[2020 Taiwanese presidential election|2020 election]]. This marked the first time since the [[2000 Taiwanese presidential election|2000 election]] that the winning candidate obtained less than 50% of the vote, and the first time that a party won more than two consecutive presidential elections since direct elections were introduced in [[1996 Taiwanese presidential election|1996]].

===Qualifications and procedure===
Presidential and vice presidential candidates are elected on the same ticket using [[first-past-the-post voting]]. This will be the eighth [[direct election]] of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] until 1996. According to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|constitution]], Tsai, having served two terms, is term-limited from office. Under Article 22 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, only the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the [[Taiwan People's Party]] (TPP), and the [[New Power Party]] (NPP), having received more than five percent of the total vote in either the last presidential or legislative election, are eligible to contest the election.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

Candidates register with the [[Central Election Commission (Taiwan)|Central Election Commission]].

If the number of joint signers reaches 1.5% of the total electors in the latest Presidential and Vice Presidential Election within the time limit, which is 45 days under normal circumstances or 25 days in case of a by-election or a reelection, the presentees will be allowed to proceed with contesting in the election after the joint signature documents are examined.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act |url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0020053 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113232230/https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0020053 |archive-date=13 January 2019 |access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref> For the 2024 presidential election, the number of signatures required for independent candidates was approximately 290,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chung |first1=Yu-chen |date=28 August 2023 |title=Election 2024/Terry Gou jumps into 2024 presidential race as independent candidate |agency=Central News Agency |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202308280003 |access-date=29 August 2023 |quote=With the declaration of his intention to join the 2024 race as an independent, Gou will now be required to obtain the signatures of at least 1.5 percent of the electorate in the last legislative election, which would mean around 290,000 signatures, within 45 days of his formal application to run as an independent candidate, according to law. |archive-date=29 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829014629/https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202308280003 |url-status=live }}</ref> The complete petition was to be submitted between 13 and 17 September 2023, and the signature collection period followed from 17 September to 2 November 2023.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chung |first1=Yu-chen |date=28 August 2023 |title=Election 2024/Terry Gou announces presidency bid, touts business acumen as key asset |agency=Central News Agency |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202308280014 |access-date=29 August 2023 |quote=Independent presidential candidates are required to file an official application to run and collect the required signatures from Sept. 13-17.

At around 20:00, Hou conceded to Lai in an address to his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei. He also apologized for failing to end eight years of DPP rule.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 January 2024 |title=KMT's Hou concedes defeat in Taiwan presidential election |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401130010 |access-date=13 January 2024 |website=Focus Taiwan |archive-date=13 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240113122236/https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401130010 |url-status=live }}</ref> At 20:04, Ko addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in New Taipei.

In a social media reflection over the campaign on 15 January, Hou's running mate Jaw Shau-kong said that in order to win future elections, the Kuomintang needed to undertake major reforms such as "incorporating a bit of socialist [messaging] on wealth equality," ensuring that its membership better reflected Taiwan's demographics, and promoting greater democracy and transparency in its nomination system.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 January 2024 |title='Major reforms' needed for KMT to return to power: Ex-VP candidate |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401150023 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116020514/https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401150023 |archive-date=16 January 2024 |access-date=16 January 2024 |website=[[Focus Taiwan]]}}</ref> At a Central Standing Committee meeting of the Kuomintang on 17 January, its leadership acknowledged that although 60% of the electorate voted against the DPP, the failure to establish a joint ticket with the TPP [[Vote splitting|undermined]] its chances of winning the election.

Amid calls within the Kuomintang for his resignation, party chairman [[Eric Chu]] insisted that he would "shoulder all responsibilities and endure humiliations to stay in the position until the end of his term" in 2025.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 January 2024 |title=Opposition split key to presidential election defeat: KMT |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401170019 |access-date=17 January 2024 |website=Focus Taiwan |archive-date=17 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240117152050/https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202401170019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
