[[Feleti Teo]] was appointed as [[Prime Minister of Tuvalu|prime minister]] on 26 February 2024 after having been elected unopposed by the parliament.

== Background ==

The previous elections in [[2019 Tuvaluan general election|2019]] saw a high turnover among the 16 members of parliament, seven of whom were the first-term members. Several [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet ministers]] lost their seats. There were two female candidates, and Dr [[Puakena Boreham]] retained a seat in parliament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tuvalu elections: large turnover for new parliament |url=https://www.abc.net.au/pacific/programs/pacificmornings/simon-kofe/11499104 |access-date=21 July 2023 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230618122152/https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/398454/tuvalu-elections-large-turnover-for-new-parliament |archive-date=18 June 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> In the vote for prime minister, held shortly after the election, parliament elected [[Kausea Natano]], defeating the incumbent head of government [[Enele Sopoaga]], who had served since 2013.<ref name=ipu>{{cite web |title=Election results |url=https://data.ipu.org/node/179/elections?chamber_id=13549 |publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |access-date=21 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230528192107/https://data.ipu.org/node/179/elections?chamber_id=13549 |archive-date=28 May 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=pm>{{cite news |title=Kausea Natano new PM of Tuvalu; Sopoaga ousted |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/399106/kausea-natano-new-pm-of-tuvalu-sopoaga-ousted |access-date=21 July 2023 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=19 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308013452/https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/399106/kausea-natano-new-pm-of-tuvalu-sopoaga-ousted |archive-date=8 March 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> The defeat of Sopoaga, who was [[pro-Taiwan]], caused some to speculate that the new prime minister would sever ties with Taipei in favour of [[China]].<ref name=R0919>{{cite web|last=Colin Packham & Jonathan Barrett|title=Tuvalu changes PM, adds to concerns over backing for Taiwan in Pacific|website=[[Reuters]]|date=19 September 2019|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy-tuvalu/tuvalu-changes-pm-adds-to-concerns-over-backing-for-taiwan-in-pacific-idUSKBN1W400A|access-date=29 January 2024|archive-date=4 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004102920/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy-tuvalu/tuvalu-changes-pm-adds-to-concerns-over-backing-for-taiwan-in-pacific-idUSKBN1W400A|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Solomon Islands]], another Pacific Islands country, had made the switch days before.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tuvalu parliament picks new PM in potential blow for Taiwan |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/9/19/tuvalu-parliament-picks-new-pm-in-potential-blow-for-taiwan |access-date=21 July 2023 |work=[[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] |date=19 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230526165015/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/9/19/tuvalu-parliament-picks-new-pm-in-potential-blow-for-taiwan |archive-date=26 May 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Prime Minister Natano later assured that Tuvalu would maintain its diplomatic ties and recognition of [[Taiwan]].<ref name=ipu/> As of 2024, Tuvalu is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tuvalu's prime minister reportedly loses his seat in crucial elections on the Pacific island nation |url=https://apnews.com/article/tuvalu-elections-island-pacific-china-taiwan-3d2a7c4c7e3f6227d1577f60330ca547 |access-date=27 January 2024 |work=Associated Press |date=27 January 2024 |archive-date=27 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240127111846/https://apnews.com/article/tuvalu-elections-island-pacific-china-taiwan-3d2a7c4c7e3f6227d1577f60330ca547 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

===Falepili Union treaty===
In November 2023 Prime Minister Natano signed the [[Australia–Tuvalu relations#Australia–Tuvalu Falepili Union|Falepili Union treaty]] with Australia. A significant factor of the treaty grants a pathway for 280 citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia each year to enable [[Climate migration|climate-related mobility]] for Tuvaluans. In exchange, the agreement allows Australia an effective veto power over Tuvalu's foreign security agreements as the 2 countries must "mutually agree" such security agreements.<ref name=union>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Lydia |title=Ex-Tuvalu PM running for office in 2024 will 'throw away' Falepili Treaty |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/503529/ex-tuvalu-pm-running-for-office-in-2024-will-throw-away-falepili-treaty |access-date=30 November 2023 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=29 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129143656/https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/503529/ex-tuvalu-pm-running-for-office-in-2024-will-throw-away-falepili-treaty |archive-date=29 November 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Natano said the treaty was essential in preserving Tuvalu's identity.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Lydia |title=Australia-Tuvalu treaty is 'to maintain our identity', Kausea Natano says |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/502395/australia-tuvalu-treaty-is-to-maintain-our-identity-kausea-natano-says |access-date=30 November 2023 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=14 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129030746/https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/502395/australia-tuvalu-treaty-is-to-maintain-our-identity-kausea-natano-says |archive-date=29 November 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> However, former Prime Minister Sopoaga claimed the Falepili Union would undermine the country's sovereignty and vowed to repeal it should he head a government again after the election.<ref name=G2024-1/><ref name=union/> Sopoaga emphasised the sensitivity of conserving the sovereignty of the Pacific Island nations amidst a period where bigger countries, such as the United States and China, are competing for influence in the region. Former Foreign Minister [[Simon Kofe]] also criticised the treaty and pledged to renegotiate with Australia. Kofe highlighted Tuvalu's contracts with numerous international companies, including those that provide the country with satellite connections and questioned if it were necessary for Tuvalu to require Australia's permission to engage with such companies.<ref name=Reuters>{{cite news |last1=Needham |first1=Kirsty |title=Tuvalu politician who stood in rising sea wants changes to Australia migration treaty |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tuvalu-politician-who-stood-rising-sea-wants-changes-australia-migration-treaty-2023-12-08/ |access-date=14 December 2023 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=8 December 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20231214004733/https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tuvalu-politician-who-stood-rising-sea-wants-changes-australia-migration-treaty-2023-12-08/ |archive-date=14 December 2023|url-status=live|location=[[Sydney]]}}</ref>
