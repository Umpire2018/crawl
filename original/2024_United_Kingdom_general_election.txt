The '''2024 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday, 4 July 2024, to elect 650 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Keir Starmer]], defeated the governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by Prime Minister [[Rishi Sunak]], in a [[landslide victory]].

The election was the first general election victory for Labour since [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], and ended the Conservatives' 14-year tenure as the primary governing party. Labour achieved a 174-seat simple majority, and a total of 411 seats, a single-party figure surpassed in modern times only by [[Stanley Baldwin]] and  the Conservatives in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] and [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] and by [[Tony Blair]] and Labour in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] and [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]].{{efn|name=Speaker|The figure does not include [[Lindsay Hoyle]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker of the House of Commons]], who was included in the Labour seat total by some media outlets.

The Conservative Party was reduced to 121 seats on a vote share of 23.7%, the worst result in its history. It lost 251 seats in total, including those of 12 [[Sunak ministry|Cabinet ministers]] and the largely rural or retirement area [[South West Norfolk in the 2024 United Kingdom general election|South West Norfolk]], the seat of the former prime minister [[Liz Truss]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 July 2024 |title=Former Prime Minister Liz Truss loses seat in U.K. election |first=Rebecca |last=Falconer |url=https://www.axios.com/2024/07/05/liz-truss-former-uk-prime-minister-general-election-loss |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240706032834/https://www.axios.com/2024/07/05/liz-truss-former-uk-prime-minister-general-election-loss |archive-date=6 July 2024 |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=Axios}}</ref> It also lost all its seats in Wales.<ref>{{Cite web |author-first1=Jennifer|author-last1=McKiernan|author-first2=Brian|author-last2=Wheeler|date=5 July 2024 |title=Rishi Sunak apologises after historic Tory defeat |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240705000825/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o |archive-date=5 July 2024 |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=BBC News}}</ref> 

Smaller parties took a record 42.6% of the vote in the election. Of these, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], led by [[Ed Davey]], made the most significant gains, securing 72 seats with a total of 3.5 million votes; like Labour, this represented a decline in their vote from 2019. It was the modern incarnation of this party's best-ever result and made it the third-largest party in the Commons, a status it had previously held but that it had lost at, and since, the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic firsts from the 2024 general election in numbers and charts |url=https://news.sky.com/story/historic-firsts-from-the-2024-general-election-in-numbers-and-charts-13163306 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240705185432/https://news.sky.com/story/historic-firsts-from-the-2024-general-election-in-numbers-and-charts-13163306 |archive-date=5 July 2024 |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=Sky News|author-first1=Hannah|author-last1=Bunting|author-first2=Joely|author-last2=Santa Cruz}}</ref> 

The [[Co-operative Party]], which is in an electoral pact with the Labour Party, also had its best ever result. They elected 43 MPs, all of which are also members of the Labour Party, designated as [[Labour Co-op]] and generally counted with the rest of the Labour MPs. [[Reform UK]] achieved the third-highest vote share at 14.3%, with over four million votes, which won it five seats, and the Green Party of England and Wales won four seats, with over 1.8 million votes; both parties achieved their best parliamentary results so far in terms of both votes and seats. 

In Scotland, the [[Scottish National Party]] was reduced from 48 seats to nine, and lost its status as the third-largest party in the Commons and as the biggest party in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web |title="Labour to form new British government after election landslide" |url=https://www.courthousenews.com/labour-to-form-new-british-government-after-election-landslide/ |last=Glover |first=Dominic |date=5 July 2024 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240707073454/https://www.courthousenews.com/labour-to-form-new-british-government-after-election-landslide/ |archive-date=7 July 2024 |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=Courthouse News Service}}</ref> In Wales, [[Plaid Cymru]] won four seats.

The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] won two seats, and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] won one seat each, and the independent unionist [[Alex Easton]] won [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]]. 

The [[Workers Party of Britain]] and the [[Alba Party]], both of which formed after the previous election, lost all their seats. Five of the six newly-elected independent MPs, including the former leader of the Labour Party [[Jeremy Corbyn]], formed the [[Independent Alliance (UK)|Independent Alliance]] group in parliament.

Labour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in [[Opinion polling for the 2024 United Kingdom general election|opinion polls]], and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period.<ref name="Walker 202423">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=20 February 2024 |title=Another Canada 93?

[[File:2019UKElectionNominalMap.svg|thumb|250x250px|The notional results of the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]], if they had taken place under boundaries recommended by the Sixth Periodic Review.]]
The election was contested under new constituency boundaries established by the [[2023 review of Westminster constituencies]]. Consequently, media outlets reported seat gains and losses as compared to [[notional results]]. These are estimates of the results if all votes cast in 2019 were unchanged, but regrouped by the new constituency boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2023 |title=2023 Boundary Review – Notional Election Results (GE2019) |url=https://paulsayers.me.uk/quick-reference-resources/2023-notional-election-results/ |access-date=14 September 2023 |website=Sayers Insights |language=en-GB |archive-date=3 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240203120813/https://paulsayers.me.uk/quick-reference-resources/2023-notional-election-results/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Since notional results in the vote counts at parliamentary elections in the UK do not yield figures at any level more specific than that of the whole constituency,<ref name="RecSwing124">{{Cite news |date=16 January 2024 |title=General election: Labour would need record swing to win |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67361138 |access-date=23 May 2024 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB |archive-date=23 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240523152251/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67361138 |url-status=live}}</ref> it is only possible to estimate the notional results, with the assistance of local election results.

In [[England]], seats were redistributed towards [[Southern England]], away from [[Northern England]], due to the different rates of population growth. [[North West England]] and [[North East England]] lost two seats each, whereas [[South East England]] gained seven and [[South West England]] gained three.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 June 2021 |title=Boundary review: Winners and losers from proposed changes |language=en-GB |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57400901 |access-date=6 October 2023 |archive-date=3 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203023104/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57400901 |url-status=live}}</ref> Based on historical voting patterns, this was expected to help the Conservatives. Using the new boundaries, different parties would have won several constituencies with unchanged names but changed boundaries [[2019 United Kingdom general election in England|from the 2019 election]]. For example, the Conservatives would have won [[Wirral West]] and [[Leeds North West]] instead of the Labour Party, but Labour would have won [[Pudsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Pudsey]] and [[Heywood & Middleton]] instead of the Conservatives. [[Westmorland and Lonsdale]], the constituency represented by former Liberal Democrat leader [[Tim Farron]], was notionally a Conservative seat.<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 November 2022 |title=Tories could gain most from new election map |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63556905 |access-date=6 October 2023 |publisher=BBC News |language=en-GB |archive-date=21 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230921154842/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63556905 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wilks-Heeg |first=Stuart |date=23 January 2024 |title=UK constituency boundaries are being redrawn to make them more equal – but it won't save the Conservatives |url=http://theconversation.com/uk-constituency-boundaries-are-being-redrawn-to-make-them-more-equal-but-it-wont-save-the-conservatives-221256 |access-date=6 July 2024 |website=The Conversation |language=en-US |archive-date=6 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240706031131/http://theconversation.com/uk-constituency-boundaries-are-being-redrawn-to-make-them-more-equal-but-it-wont-save-the-conservatives-221256 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[Scotland]], 57 MPs were elected, down from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|59 in 2019]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Media |first=P.

The Scottish National Party would have remained steady on 48 seats despite two of its constituencies being dissolved. The [[Scottish Conservatives]]' seat count of six would likewise remained unchanged. [[Scottish Labour]] would have retained [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]], the sole constituency they won in 2019. Had the 2019 general election occurred with the new boundaries in effect, the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] would have only won two seats ([[Edinburgh West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh West]] and [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]]), instead of the four they did win that year, as the expanded electorates in the other two would overcome their slender majorities.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sim |first=Philip |date=6 June 2024 |title=How Scotland's new election map reshapes the race |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-69053055 |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=BBC News |archive-date=6 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240706025036/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-69053055 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Under the new boundaries, [[Wales]] lost eight seats, electing 32 MPs instead of the 40 it [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Wales|elected in 2019]]. [[Welsh Labour]] would have won 18 instead of the 22 MPs it elected in 2019, and the [[Welsh Conservatives]] 12 instead of 14. Due to the abolition and merging of rural constituencies in [[West Wales]], [[Plaid Cymru]] would have only won two seats instead of four. Nonetheless, the boundary changes were expected to cause difficulty for the Conservatives as more pro-Labour areas were added to some of their strongest seats.<ref>{{Cite news |date=28 June 2023 |title=Map of Welsh MPs seats redrawn as number to be cut to 32 |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-65989015 |access-date=6 October 2023 |archive-date=23 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240523071233/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-65989015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Campaign ==
=== Overview ===

{{UK general election opinion polling|2010|2015|2017|2019|la2=yes|la3=yes|la4=yes|la5=yes|2024}}
Discussion around the campaign was focused on the prospect of a change in government, as Labour maintained significant leads in opinion polling over the Conservatives, with one in five voters voting tactically.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 July 2024 |title=One in five voters say they are voting tactically at the 2024 general election |url=https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/49886-one-in-five-voters-say-they-are-voting-tactically-at-the-2024-general-election |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240707073451/https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/49886-one-in-five-voters-say-they-are-voting-tactically-at-the-2024-general-election |archive-date=7 July 2024 |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=YouGov}}</ref> Projections four weeks before the vote indicated a landslide victory for Labour that surpassed the one achieved by [[Tony Blair]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], while comparisons were made in the media to the [[1993 Canadian federal election]] due to the prospect of a potential Conservative [[Wipeout (elections)|wipeout]].<ref name="Walker 202423"/><ref name="Hunt 202423"/> A [[YouGov]] poll conducted four weeks before the vote suggested that Labour was on course for the party's biggest election victory in history, beating Blair's 1997 landslide. The poll indicated Labour could win 422 seats, while the Conservatives were projected to win 140 seats.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zakir-Hussain |first=Maryam |date=3 June 2024 |title=General Election polls – latest: Labour set to win more seats than Blair in 1997, shock YouGov forecast says |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-2024-poll-tracker-labour-tories-yougov-b2555754.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240603145109/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-2024-poll-tracker-labour-tories-yougov-b2555754.html |archive-date=3 June 2024 |access-date=3 June 2024 |work=The Independent}}</ref>

Halfway through the campaign, psephologist [[John Curtice]] summarised the polls as having shown little change in the first two weeks of the campaign but that they had then shown some clear shifts. Specifically, both the Conservatives and Labour had shown a decline of a few percentage points, leaving the gap between them unchanged, while Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats had both shown an increase, with one YouGov poll published 13 June attracting attention for showing Reform UK one point above the Conservatives.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 June 2024 |title=John Curtice on the Farage effect |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11jpqgzp4o |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240615125456/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11jpqgzp4o |archive-date=15 June 2024 |access-date=14 June 2024 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Reform now 1pt ahead of the Tories, although this is still within the margin of error {{!}} YouGov |url=https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/49735-reform-now-1pt-ahead-of-the-tories-although-this-is-still-within-the-margin-of-error |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240615125458/https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/49735-reform-now-1pt-ahead-of-the-tories-although-this-is-still-within-the-margin-of-error |archive-date=15 June 2024 |access-date=14 June 2024 |website=yougov.co.uk |language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[File:Runners up in the 2024 UK GE.svg|thumb|Runners up in each constituency]]
The result was a landslide win for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and a historic loss for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party in the early 19th century, and the largest defeat for any incarnation of the [[Tories]] in purely numeric terms since [[1761 British general election|1761]] when they achieved 112 MPs, up from their all time numeric low of 106 in [[1754 British general election|1754]], although those made up a higher percentage of seats in Parliament (18.9% in 1754 and 20.1% in 1761 as opposed to 18.6% in 2024) due to the smaller sized House of Commons in 1754–1761 of 557 MPs. The Conservatives won no seats in [[Wales]] or various English counties, including [[Cornwall]] and [[Oxfordshire]] (the latter historically known for having several safe Conservative seats), and they only won one seat in [[North East England]].<ref name="historicfirsts"/> Keir Starmer became the fourth prime minister in a two-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxr2yzy22kyo|title='Starmer tsunami' and civility after brutality|last=Mason|first=Chris|date=5 July 2024|website=BBC News}}</ref> Turnout, at 59.9%, was the second lowest since records began in [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]] with only [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] being lower at 59.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nglegege1o|title=General election 2024 in maps and charts|date=4 July 2024|website=BBC News}}</ref>

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] made significant gains to reach their highest ever number of seats, mostly gaining Conservative seats in [[Southern England]]. This was also the best performance since its predecessor [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] won 158 seats in [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=2024-07-05 |title=Lib Dems oust four cabinet ministers as they win record number of seats |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/04/ed-davey-support-liberal-democrats-exit-poll-near-record-seat-count |access-date=2024-07-12 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> (itself a higher score than the Conservatives achieved in this 2024 election) and superior to Labour's [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]] and [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] performances, as second-placed official Opposition on both occasions. [[Reform UK]] had MPs elected to the Commons for the first time.

The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) lost around three quarters of its seats to [[Scottish Labour]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk22"/> Labour returned to being the largest party in Scotland and remained so in Wales, although their vote share fell in Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt|title=UK general election results live: Keir Starmer arrives at Downing Street for first speech as prime minister|website=BBC News}}</ref>

Because the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] lost 3 seats, [[Sinn Féin]] won the most seats in [[Northern Ireland]], making it the first time an Irish nationalist party was the largest party in Parliament from Northern Ireland. The [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] entered the Commons for the first time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8978z7z8w4o|title=Sinn Féin becomes NI's largest Westminster party|date=4 July 2024|website=BBC News}}</ref> In [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], independent Unionist candidate [[Alex Easton]] emerged victorious over the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] incumbent [[Stephen Farry]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=North Down – General election results 2024 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2024/uk/constituencies/N05000013 |access-date=2024-07-05 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> resulting in the election of a total of six independent MPs across the UK.

Four [[independent candidates]] ([[Ayoub Khan]], [[Adnan Hussain]], [[Iqbal Mohamed]], [[Shockat Adam]]) outright defeated Labour candidates as well as one ([[Claudia Webbe]]) acting as a spoiler to defeat one in areas with large [[Muslim]] populations; the results were suggested to be a push-back against Labour's stance on the [[Gaza war|Israel–Hamas war]] and [[Gaza humanitarian crisis]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stacey |first=Kiran |last2= |first2= |date=5 July 2024 |title=Senior Labour figures admit stance on Gaza cost party seats |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/labour-loses-three-seats-to-pro-palestinian-candidates |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ford |first=Robert |date=7 July 2024 |title=Labour put 'safe' seats at risk to target marginals.

=== Proportionality concerns ===
[[File:Proportional results of the 2024 UK General Election.svg|thumb|Seats won in the election (outer ring) versus number of votes (inner ring)]]
The combined vote share for Labour and the Conservatives reached a record low, with smaller parties doing well, and this election had the lowest vote share for any party forming a majority government since [[World War II]].<ref name=hocl-20240924>{{cite web |page=6,11 |url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-10009/CBP-10009.pdf |title=General election 2024: Results and analysis |last1=Cracknell |first1=Richard |last2=Baker |first2=Carl |publisher=UK Parliament |work=House of Commons Library |id=CBP-10009 |date=24 September 2024 |access-date=22 November 2024}}</ref>

The election was highly [[Disproportionality|disproportionate]], as Labour won 63% of seats (411) with only 34% of the vote, while Reform won under 0.8% of seats (5) with 14.3% of the vote under the UK's [[first-past-the-post voting system]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Surridge |first=Paula |author-link=Paula Surridge |date=5 July 2024 |title=Labour wins big but the UK's electoral system is creaking |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/labour-wins-big-uk-electoral-system-creaking |access-date=5 July 2024 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The Liberal Democrats recorded their best ever seat result (72), despite receiving only around half the votes they did in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]],<ref name="The Guardian">{{Cite web |date=5 July 2024 |title=The Guardian view on Labour's landslide: becoming the change the country needs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-labours-landslide-becoming-the-change-the-country-needs |access-date=5 July 2024 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> and fewer votes overall than Reform, although the party's seat share was again lower than its share of the vote. As Starmer's government was elected with the lowest share of the vote of any majority party on record, journalist [[Fraser Nelson]] described Labour's electoral success as a "[[Potemkin village|Potemkin]] landslide".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |author-link=Fraser Nelson |date=5 July 2024 |title=Labour's Potemkin landslide |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/labours-potemkin-landslide/ |access-date=5 July 2024 |website=The Spectator}}</ref> An [[editorial]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the result as a "crisis of electoral legitimacy" for the incoming Labour government.<ref name="The Guardian"/>

The [[Gallagher index]] gave the election a 23.67 score, making it the least proportionate election in modern UK history according to the index, as well as the 5th least proportional result worldwide as of 2024.<ref name="data">{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Michael |title=Election Indices |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/about/people/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240729233608/https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/about/people/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf |archive-date=29 July 2024 |access-date=29 July 2024}}</ref> According to political scientist [[John Curtice]], the 2024 election was the most disproportional in British history and Labour's parliamentary majority was "heavily exaggerated" by the voting system.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Curtice |first=John |author-link=John Curtice |date=5 July 2024 |title=Labour's strength in Commons is heavily exaggerated |url=https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/john-curtice-general-election-labour-victory-results-7cpgvbrcs |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=[[The Times]]}}</ref> Advocacy group [[Make Votes Matter]] found that 58% of voters did not vote for their elected MP. Make Votes Matter spokesman Steve Gilmore, [[Electoral Reform Society]] chief [[Darren Hughes]], Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and the Green Party of England and Wales co-leader Adrian Ramsay were among the figures that called for electoral reform in the wake of the election. The campaigners said it was the "most disproportionate election in [British] history".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/08/disproportionate-uk-election-results-boost-calls-to-ditch-first-past-the-post|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=8 July 2024|title='Disproportionate' UK election results boost calls to ditch first past the post|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=8 July 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c886pl6ldy9o|date=5 July 2024|title=Biggest-ever gap between number of votes and MPs hits Reform and Greens|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=8 July 2024}}</ref>

{{Blockquote|text=Whilst he has been my political opponent, Sir Keir Starmer will shortly become our Prime Minister. In this job, his successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well. Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent, public-spirited man, who I respect. He and his family deserve the very best of our understanding, as they make the huge transition to their new lives behind this door, and as he grapples with this most demanding of jobs in an increasingly unstable world.}}Starmer succeeded Sunak as prime minister, ending 14 years of the Conservatives in government.

{{Blockquote|text=From now on, you have a government unburdened by doctrine guided only by the determination to serve your interest, to defy, quietly, those who have written our country off. You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change. To restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives and unite our country. Four nations standing together again, facing down as we have so often in our past, the challenges of an insecure world committed to a calm and patient rebuilding. So with respect and humility, I invite you all to join this government of service in the mission of national renewal. Our work is urgent, and we begin it today.}}
