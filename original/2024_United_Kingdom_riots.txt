The riots began in Southport, just a few streets away from where the attack took place. A demonstration outside the Southport Mosque quickly turned violent and protesters attacked police officers, injuring over fifty, burned a police van, and attacked the mosque. Over the following days the unrest spread to other towns and cities in England and to [[Belfast]] in Northern Ireland. On 31 July, over 100 protesters were arrested in [[London]] and demonstrations occurred in [[Manchester]], [[Hartlepool]], and [[Aldershot]]. On 2 August, rioting took place in [[Sunderland]], where a [[Citizens Advice]] bureau was set on fire and police officers were injured and several people were arrested. The most severe rioting took place over the weekend of 3–4 August, when anti-immigration protesters clashed with police and counter-protesters, attacked homes and businesses owned by immigrants, and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. From 6 August the unrest began to abate; counter-protests consistently and considerably outnumbered far-right protesters, and were followed by large anti-racist rallies across the country on 7 August.  Online forums, the formation of safe spaces and other activities also countered racist sentiment and supported affected communities.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=Natasha |date=2024-08-07 |title=Responding to the Racist UK Riots |url=https://commonslibrary.org/responding-to-the-racist-uk-riots/ |access-date=2025-03-05 |website=The Commons Social Change Library |language=en-AU}}</ref>

On 23 December it was reported that a 40-year-old from Southport, who had been identified as a man seen in a viral video of the 30 July rioting, had been sentenced to two years and six months in jail after pleading guilty to violent disorder at Liverpool Crown Court, which involved throwing bins at officers and punching a police vehicle. In the viral video he can be seen walking up to a line of riot police, putting his hands on his hips, and gyrating in front of them. He is then struck in the chest and head by hurled bricks before turning around and walking back towards the crowd. As he holds his head, another brick hits him in the groin. Later that evening, officers were called to a separate incident at which he was present. They took him to Southport hospital to be treated for the head injury, where the police say he racially abused another patient. The officers recognised him from the already widely shared footage and he was arrested.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/man-who-featured-in-viral-video-after-being-hit-in-groin-during-southport-riot-is-jailed-13279464|work=[[Sky News]]|date=23 December 2024|access-date=23 December 2024|title=Man who featured in viral video after being hit in groin during Southport riot is jailed}}</ref>

During the protests, widespread disinformation blaming immigrants and Muslims for crime were shared online.<ref name="Financial Times-2024" /> [[Andrew Chadwick]], a professor of political communication at [[Loughborough University]], described a viral tweet as being "deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it's a potentially [[Islamophobic]] piece of propaganda".<ref name="Sands-2024" /> [[Matthew Feldman (historian)|Matthew Feldman]], an expert on right-wing extremism, commented "It is difficult to think of a much better example of online harms breaching the real world than a fake story demonising Muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pennink |first=Emily |date=2 August 2024 |title=Call for urgent action to tackle 'tsunami of lies' behind Southport protest |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/southport-prime-minister-english-defence-league-muslims-government-b2590217.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240802145409/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/southport-prime-minister-english-defence-league-muslims-government-b2590217.html |archive-date=2 August 2024 |access-date=2 August 2024 |language=en |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Former security minister [[Stephen McPartland]] accused Russia and [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin's regime]] of involvement in the campaign of misinformation, describing it as "part of the Russian playbook".<ref name="Martin-2024" /> Days later, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that misinformation and conspiracy regarding the suspect remained and appeared to be the motivating force behind the protests.<ref name="watling" />

Extremism experts attributed the large far-right rally in London, led by Robinson a week prior to the protests as having boosted supporters, with Robinson playing a significant role in inciting outrage. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' described the evolution of the movement from "more formally organised [[White Supremacist|white-supremacist]] groups into personality-driven splinter groups", while capitalising on social media for outreach and organising.<ref name="Financial Times-2024" /> Police officials have described organisers as being in distinct far-right groups, organising online under banners such as "enough is enough", "save our kids", and "[[stop the boats]]" (the latter in reference to [[English Channel migrant crossings (2018–present)|migrant crossings of the English Channel]]), with Robinson being a central figure in calls to hold riots.<ref name="aljaz" /> Writing for ''[[The Observer]],'' [[Shabana Mahmood]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], suggested the impact of the disorder would be "felt for months and years to come" as the volume of cases linked to the riots going through the courts would affect government plans to address a backlog of cases.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Howard |first=Jacqueline |date=11 August 2024 |title=Impact of riots will be felt for years, justice secretary warns |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvy314jr3go |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240811030315/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvy314jr3go |archive-date=11 August 2024 |accessdate=11 August 2024 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Data recorded by [[ACLED]] shows the riots significantly increased the number of violent demonstrations across the United Kingdom in 2024, exceeding the totals of 2020 and 2021 which were affected by the [[Covid-19 pandemic]]. <ref>{{Cite web |date=9 August 2024 |title=Anti-migrant rioting and anti-racist response in the UK |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep62215?seq=1 |url-status=live |accessdate=20 January 2025 |website=Jstor}}</ref>
