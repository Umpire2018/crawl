The head of the President's Office, [[Gholam-Hossein Esmaeili]], was in one of the other helicopters. He stated that the helicopters took off at around 13:00. The weather was normal at the start and during most of the flight. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the pilot of Raisi's helicopter, who was in charge of the convoy, ordered other helicopters to increase altitude to avoid a nearby cloud. After 30 seconds of flying over the cloud, the pilot of Esmaeili's helicopter noticed that Raisi's helicopter, which was flying between the two others, had disappeared. The pilot returned to search for Raisi's helicopter and made a few circles, but was unable to contact it via radio and could not descend because of the cloud, so he landed at the nearby [[Sungun copper mine]] 30 seconds later.<ref name="IRNA">{{cite news |url=https://en.irna.ir/news/85485620/Official-reveals-more-details-of-president-Raisi-s-copter-crash |title=Official reveals more details of president Raisi's copter crash |date=21 May 2024 |website=IRNA |access-date=22 May 2024 |archive-date=22 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240522083037/https://en.irna.ir/news/85485620/Official-reveals-more-details-of-president-Raisi-s-copter-crash |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="IRNA-ru" /> The pilots then called the phone of Captain Mostafavi, who was in charge of Raisi's helicopter, but Ale-Hashem answered, who said the helicopter had crashed into a valley.
