==Causes==
[[File:ECDM 20240805 India Kerala.pdf|thumb|right|300px| Landslide location and the debris flow route]]
===Anthropological factors===
Landslides can be caused by heavy rain fall, slope of the land, poor construction techniques, and poor-planned land use.<ref name="Anthropological activities">{{Cite web|title=Anthropological activities|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-landslides-causes-wayanad-tragedy-9488385/|access-date=12 August 2024 |website=Indian express|quote=Landslides are natural phenomena that usually occur in mountainous regions with steep slopes. During a landslide, large amounts of rock, boulders, loose mud, soil, and debris roll down slopes and hillsides, gathering great momentum and often taking vegetation or buildings along.}}</ref> 

According to the latest census data provided by the [[Government of India]], the population of Wayanad district increased 11-fold over the past century, from 75,149 in 1901 to 817,420 in 2011, within an area of {{Convert|2132|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Population of Wayand">{{Cite web|title=Population of Wayand|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/273-wayanad.html|access-date=20 August 2024 |website=census2011}}</ref> With the increase in the population, tourism also boomed in the area in the recent decades as affluent travelers started visiting the plateau district for extended weekends. According to the state tourism department's data, tourist arrivals into the state grew 72% from 2003 (6.16 million) to 2023 ( 22.52 million). Out of the 19.21 millions tourists who visited Kerala in 2022, 1.51 million visited Wayanad district alone. To host such a large number of tourists, many resorts have been built.<ref name="Tourism Hazard">{{Cite web|title=Tourism Hazards|url=https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-why-the-wayanad-landslide-must-not-fade-from-memory/|access-date=19 August 2024 |website=mongabay|quote=Wayanad is a late bloomer among plateaus. The plateau is at an altitude where the prevalence of malaria is high. Unlike the Idukki plateau where pioneering settler-agriculturists started moving in, in the late 19th Century, braving the disease, settlers moved into Wayanad after the discovery of synthetic malaria drugs after the 1940s. Before that, it was the land of indigenous communities in enclaves. The tourism boom for Wayanad had been in the recent decades when the affluent and mobile from cities such as Bengaluru started travelling to the plateau district for extended weekends. According to the Census data, Wayanad district had a settled population of 75,149 in 1901, which grew to 817,420 by the 2011 Census. The settler boom decades started after the 1941 census (106,350) and stabilised by the 2001 census (780,619). In short, between 1941 and 2001, the population of the district grew by 7.34 times over these six decades. Compare this with the fact that between 1901 and 1941 the population had only grown by 1.41 times.}}</ref>

===Deforestation===
The [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]] in Kochi conducted a study on soil [[topography]] and [[geomorphology]] of Wayanad and concluded that major [[deforestation]] occurred in Wayanad district as a result of the creation of [[tea plantation]]s, which contributed to the landslides.<ref name="CUSAT">{{Cite web|title=CUSAT|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-wayanad-landslides-live-updates-9505918/|access-date=10 August 2024 |website=Indian express|quote=S Abhilash, director of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR) at Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, told The Indian Express that the cutting of trees to create plantations is contributing to landslides in Kerala.}}</ref><ref name="Deforestation">{{Cite web|title=Deforestation|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-landslides-causes-wayanad-tragedy-9488385/|access-date=12 August 2024 |website=Indian express|quote=Most of the landslides that are taking place in Kerala are around plantation areas, indicating another major triggering factor — agricultural activities such as monocropping, in which large, native trees, which hold the top soil to the bedrock, are cut down. These trees are being replaced by big plantation crops, such as tea and coffee, which have shallow roots.}}</ref>
 
Another study published in 2022 by the [[International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health]] on deforestation in Wayanad district showed that 62% of green cover in the district disappeared between 1950 and 2018, while tea plantation cover rose by around 1800%, leaving less forest to keep muddy hills stable.<ref name="International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health">{{Cite web|title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/did-unchecked-rise-in-construction-tourism-lead-to-wayanad-landslides-heres-what-we-know-439681-2024-08-01 |access-date=1 August 2024 |website=Business Today}}</ref> [[Kerala]]'s hilly regions have slopes of more than 20 degrees, increasing the risk of flash floods during heavy rains.<ref name="Flash flood">{{Cite web|title=Flash flood|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/did-unchecked-rise-in-construction-tourism-lead-to-wayanad-landslides-heres-what-we-know-439681-2024-08-01 |access-date=1 August 2024 |website=Business Today}}</ref>

"The region experienced more than 570 mm of rainfall within three days. The water flowing downhill likely accumulated downstream, creating a damming effect. A damming occurs when a barrier forms downstream following heavy rainfall, leading to the accumulation of a large volume of water. The second cloudburst may have broken this barrier, causing a deluge of water to rush downhill at high speed, uprooting trees and sweeping along massive boulders and rocks. This happened eight km downstream," he explained to the media on Thursday.}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===CMDRF transparency===
The Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) faced criticism on social media, with some accusing it of lacking transparency and misusing funds. The chief minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan denied these claims, emphasising that the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|Comptroller and Auditor General]] audited the CMDRF from 2016 to 2019 and found no irregularities. He further stated that the CMDRF was completely open to scrutiny by the [[Kerala Legislative Assembly]] and operated entirely on a transparent electronic platform that tracked all incoming and outgoing funds. He further stated that all transactions of CMDRF could be accessed by the general public through the [[Right to Information Act, 2005|right to information act]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Thiruvananthapuram Bureau |first=The Hindu |date=6 August 2024 |title=Wayanad landslides: Kerala CM slams attempts to undermine CMDRF’s credibility |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-slams-attempts-to-undermine-cmdrfs-credibility/article68493477.ece |access-date=9 August 2024 |work=The Hindu |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X}}</ref> Both the ruling [[Left Democratic Front]] and opposition United Democratic Front expressed full support for the CMDRF, with all MLAs from both sides contributing to the fund.<ref>{{Cite web| date= |title=LDF and UDF MLA donate their salary |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-ldf-udf-ask-their-mlas-mps-to-donate-in-cm-relief-fund-101723058026418.html|access-date=12 August 2024}}</ref> In response to the allegations against the CMDRF, FIRs were lodged against 14 individuals, including the owner of online news portal Marunadan Malayali, Shajan Skaria<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/kerala-government-oppostion-congress-unite-against-propaganda-on-chief-ministers-disaster-relief-fund/cid/2038331|title=LDF and UDF UNITE against smear campaign.FIR filed against 14 people includes Marunadan Malayali|access-date=12 August 2024}}</ref> and film director Akhil Marar.<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 August 2024 |title=Case against Bigg Boss Malayalam winner Akhil Marar for the post on Chief Minister’s Distress Relief fund |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/malayalam/case-against-bigg-boss-malayalam-winner-akhil-marar-for-the-post-on-chief-ministers-distress-relief-fund/articleshow/112287421.cms |access-date=9 August 2024 |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257}}</ref>
