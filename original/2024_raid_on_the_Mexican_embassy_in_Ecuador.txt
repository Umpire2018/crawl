On 5 April 2024, the Mexican embassy in [[Quito]] was raided by [[Ecuador]]ian police and military forces. [[Mexico]] and numerous other countries decried the raid as a violation of the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and the 1954 [[Convention on Diplomatic Asylum|Caracas Convention on Diplomatic Asylum]].<ref name="Guardian20240408"/>

The raid was carried out to arrest the former vice president of Ecuador, [[Jorge Glas]], who had been sentenced for corruption and had been living in the embassy since 17 December 2023.<ref name="eluniverso">{{cite web |date=6 April 2024 |title=Policía saca a Jorge Glas de la Embajada de México en Quito |trans-title=Police remove Jorge Glas from the Mexican Embassy in Quito |url=https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/politica/policia-saca-a-jorge-glas-de-la-embajada-de-mexico-en-quito-nota/ |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=El Universo |language=es |archive-date=6 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406043842/https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/politica/policia-saca-a-jorge-glas-de-la-embajada-de-mexico-en-quito-nota/ |url-status=live}}</ref> A few hours before the attack, he had been granted [[political asylum]].<ref name="DW1" />

In December 2023, former Ecuadorian vice president Jorge Glas, who had served as vice president under presidents [[Rafael Correa]] and [[Lenín Moreno]], entered the Mexican embassy in Quito to request [[Political asylum|asylum]], alleging political persecution.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mella |first=Carolina |date=1 March 2024 |title=La Cancillería de Ecuador pide entrar en la Embajada de México para capturar al ex vicepresidente Jorge Glas |trans-title=The Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry requests entry to the Mexican Embassy to capture ex-vice president Jorge Glas |url=https://elpais.com/america/2024-03-01/la-cancilleria-de-ecuador-pide-entrar-en-la-embajada-de-mexico-para-capturar-a-jorge-glas.html |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=El País América |language=es |archive-date=17 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240317101100/https://elpais.com/america/2024-03-01/la-cancilleria-de-ecuador-pide-entrar-en-la-embajada-de-mexico-para-capturar-a-jorge-glas.html |url-status=live}}</ref> The former vice president had been sentenced in December 2017 to serve eight years in prison for two sentences: one of six years for illicit association and another of eight years for bribery.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 April 2024 |title=Quién es Jorge Glas, el exvicepresidente en el centro de la ruptura diplomática de México con su país |trans-title=Jorge Glas, the ex-vice president of Ecuador at the center of Mexico's diplomatic rupture with his country |url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/crg4gjnp22eo |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=BBC News Mundo |language=es |archive-date=6 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406134625/https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/crg4gjnp22eo |url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2022, Glas was released but could not leave the country during the remainder of his sentences. The attorney general's office then said it was insisting on charging Glas with respect to the case involving public funds collected to aid the reconstruction of [[Manabí Province]] after [[2016 Ecuador earthquake|a 2016 earthquake]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Valencia |first=Alexandra |date=22 December 2023 |title=Former Ecuador VP asks for asylum in Mexico -lawyer |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-ecuador-vp-asks-asylum-mexico-lawyer-2023-12-22/ |url-access=registration |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=Reuters}}</ref> On 17 December, Glas entered the Mexican embassy in Quito and requested political asylum, alleging he was being persecuted politically in Ecuador.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/america/2024-03-01/la-cancilleria-de-ecuador-pide-entrar-en-la-embajada-de-mexico-para-capturar-a-jorge-glas.html|title=La Cancillería de Ecuador pide entrar en la Embajada de México para capturar al ex vicepresidente Jorge Glas|access-date=6 April 2024|last=Mella|first=Carolina|date=1 March 2024|work=El País América|language=es|archive-date=17 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240317101100/https://elpais.com/america/2024-03-01/la-cancilleria-de-ecuador-pide-entrar-en-la-embajada-de-mexico-para-capturar-a-jorge-glas.html|url-status=live}}</ref> 

During the following months, the judicial proceedings required by the Ecuadorian Prosecutor's Office could not continue due to the absence of the defendant. The Ecuadorian Government then urged the Government of Mexico to comment on the situation of Jorge Glas. On 29 January 2024, the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry sent a letter to the Ambassador of Mexico, in which it made clear Ecuador's position regarding the condition of Jorge Glas as a fugitive from Ecuadorian justice and the illegality that would constitute an eventual granting of asylum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/jorge-glas-cancilleria-confirma-solicito-ingreso-embajada-mexico-detenerlo-100342.html|title=Jorge Glas: Cancillería confirma que solicitó ingreso a Embajada de México para detenerlo|access-date=23 April 2024|work=Diario Extra|language=es|archive-date=23 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240423213350/https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/jorge-glas-cancilleria-confirma-solicito-ingreso-embajada-mexico-detenerlo-100342.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After a prolonged silence on the part of the Mexican authorities, on 1 March, the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry asked Mexico for authorization to enter its Embassy and capture Jorge Glas, a communication that received no response.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/jorge-glas-cancilleria-confirma-solicito-ingreso-embajada-mexico-detenerlo-100342.html|title=Jorge Glas: Cancillería confirma que solicitó ingreso a Embajada de México para detenerlo|access-date=23 April 2024|work=Diario Extra|language=es|archive-date=23 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240423213350/https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/jorge-glas-cancilleria-confirma-solicito-ingreso-embajada-mexico-detenerlo-100342.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Instead, on 3 April, Mexican president [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] alluded in a press conference to the fact that [[Luisa González]], the presidential candidate of the pro-Correa [[Citizen Revolution Movement]], had an advantage in polling for the [[2023 Ecuadorian general election]], but that after the murder of [[Fernando Villavicencio]] her polling numbers had dropped,<ref name=primicias/> implying the assassination had affected the election results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/5/amid-diplomatic-spat-mexico-grants-former-ecuadorian-vice-president-asylum|title=Amid diplomatic spat, Mexico grants former Ecuadorian vice president asylum|website=Al Jazeera|access-date=7 April 2024|archive-date=6 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406212849/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/5/amid-diplomatic-spat-mexico-grants-former-ecuadorian-vice-president-asylum|url-status=live}}</ref>

Commenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made "exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people or narco-terrorists", and that he would "not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum", arguing that such actions were against the Vienna Convention and other international agreements.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 April 2024 |title=Ecuadorians wanted an action man.

She added that it was not "legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts".<ref name="ap"/>

===Mexico===
Immediately following the raid, Roberto Canseco, head of the embassy's consular section and acting head of mission, called the incident "crazy" and expressed concern over Glas's life.<ref name="ap"/> After the news spread of the raid, on the same day, President López Obrador announced on [[Twitter|X (Twitter)]] the severing of all [[diplomatic relations]] with Ecuador.
