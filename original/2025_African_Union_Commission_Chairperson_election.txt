An [[African Union]] (AU) [[Chairperson of the African Union Commission|Commission Chairperson]] election was held in February 2025 to choose the fifth Commission Chair to succeed Chairperson [[Moussa Faki]].<ref name="AA">{{cite web |url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article/id/14846/Raila_Odinga%27s_bid_for_AU_chair_wins_consensus_in_Nairobi |title=Raila Odinga's bid for AU chair wins consensus in Nairobi |date=21 February 2024 |website= |publisher=[[Africa Confidential]] |access-date=28 February 2024 |quote=}}</ref> On 15 February 2025, Djibouti's [[Mahamoud Ali Youssouf]] was elected with 33 votes in the seventh round of voting.

== Background ==
Nominations were open until 6 August 2024. The new chair was elected at the 38th AU Summit in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia, in February 2025 by the [[Assembly of the African Union|AU Assembly]] via a [[secret ballot]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/realtime/2024-03-05-explainer-how-au-commission-chair-election-is-conducted/ |title=EXPLAINER: How AU Commission chair election is conducted |last=Kipkemoi |first=Felix |date=5 March 2024 |work=The Star |access-date=3 April 2024 |quote=}}</ref>

Past chairpersons have hailed from western, central and southern [[regions of the African Union]]. The [[Executive Council of the African Union|AU Executive Council]] asserted the right of the East African region to produce the next chairperson and North Africa was therefore assigned the [[Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission|deputy chairperson post]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/raila-odinga-path-to-african-union-commission-chair-easier-4557476 |title=Raila Odinga's path to African Union Commission chair post gets easier |last=Mutambo |first=Aggrey |date=15 March 2024 |website= |publisher=The East African |access-date=3 April 2024 |quote=}}</ref>

The election was overshadowed by various conflicts afflicting the continent, particularly the [[M23 campaign (2022–present)|M23 offensive]] in the DR Congo.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Focus on Africa - African Union members elect new leader - BBC Sounds |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0krstcb |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Candidates are nominated by their respective countries. The three final candidates had varying campaign agendas.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Who Will Lead the AU?

Kenya's [[Raila Odinga]] is a well-known figure in Kenyan politics with a strong reputation, and was considered by many to have been the leading candidate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-11-11 |title=Raila Odinga Leads in African Union Commission Chairperson Election Poll by Pan African Forum (UK) Ltd |url=https://www.k47.co.ke/raila-odinga-leads-in-african-union-commission-chairperson-election-poll-by-pan-african-forum-uk-ltd/ |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=K47 Digital News |language=en-US}}</ref> He wanted to use Africa's natural and human resources to ensure prosperity. He prioritised the [[African Continental Free Trade Area]], managing conflicts, and propelling Africa's global influence.<ref name=":2" />

Djibouti's [[Mahamoud Ali Youssouf]] is the longest serving Djiboutian Foreign Minister and is well-versed in international diplomacy. He emphasised integration, peace, and good governance.<ref name=":2" />

Madagascar's [[Richard Randriamandrato]] is an expert in governance and [[international relations]]. He emphasised solidarity between nation states amid fierce global competition, particularly around natural resources and international powers. He also emphasised the need for the AU to be more proactive in conflict mediation and [[sustainable development]].<ref name=":2" />

==Mjadala Afrika==
The 2024 edition of the [[Mjadala Afrika]] ("African debate" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) took place on 13 December. It offered the three candidates an opportunity to lay out their vision for the continent and how to deal with its pressing challenges. The candidates introduced themselves and answered questions posed by two moderators (one English-speaking, the other French-speaking), along with questions from online participants. The debate's format sought to encourage transparency and direct communication with the African people. The debate was televised via [[public broadcasters]] of the 55 member states.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mjadala Afrika: A landmark event in the lead-up to the new AUC Chairperson election {{!}} African Union |url=https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20241204/mjadala-afrika-landmark-event-lead-new-auc-chairperson-election |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=au.int}}</ref>

All three candidates supported Africa's bid to have two seats with veto power on the [[United Nations Security Council]] in order to amplify the continent's voice in global affairs and have representation at the highest levels of decision-making. The candidates discussed the issue of dependency in security matters, highlighting the importance of the [[African Standby Force]]. The candidates also discussed ways to enhance the [[African Continental Free Trade Area]] by introducing a single currency and payment compensation systems, aimed at improving economic growth. They also all emphasised structural reforms and cooperation between member states.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=14 January 2025 |title=Mjadala Afrika Leadership Debate: Candidates for African Union Commission Chairperson Articulate Bold Visions for the Continent's Future |url=https://www.africanparliamentarynews.com/2025/01/mjadala-afrika-leadership-debate.html |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=AFRICAN PARLIAMENTARY NEWS}}</ref> Candidates also lamented the decline of [[pan-Africanism]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mjadala Afrika: The AU Chairperson Elections & 2024 Candidate Debate – Centre for International Policy Studies |url=https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2024/12/19/mjadala-afrika-the-au-chairperson-elections-2024-candidate-debate/ |access-date=2025-02-17 |language=en-US}}</ref>
