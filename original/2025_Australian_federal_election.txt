{{2025 Australian federal election sidebar}}
The '''2025 Australian federal election''' will be held on Saturday 3 May 2025 to elect members of the 48th [[Parliament of Australia]]. All 150 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 40 of the 76 seats in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] will be contested. 

The [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Albanese government|government]], led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Anthony Albanese]], is seeking re-election for a second term. It is being challenged by the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-National Coalition]] led by [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|opposition leader]] [[Peter Dutton]], which is attempting to return to government after one term in opposition. Many [[Minor party|minor parties]] and [[Independent (politician)|independents]] are also contesting the election.

==Background==
===Previous election===
{{main|2022 Australian federal election}}
{{see also|Results of the 2022 Australian federal election (House of Representatives)|Results of the 2022 Australian federal election (Senate)}}
At the previous election in May 2022, the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], led by [[Anthony Albanese]], formed government after nine years in opposition, winning 77 seats in the House of Representatives, enough for a two-seat majority. The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]–[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] that had previously governed won only 58 seats and went into [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]]. The [[Crossbencher|crossbench]], made up of other parties and [[Independent politician|independents]], expanded to 16 seats; ten held by independents (including seven held by a loose grouping of [[teal independents]]), four by the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], and one each by [[Centre Alliance]] and [[Katter's Australian Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/results|title=Australian Federal Election 2022 Live Results|website=ABC News|access-date=2 June 2022|archive-date=21 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521011310/https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/results|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the Senate, Labor made no gains and remained steady at 26 seats overall thus requiring 13 additional votes in the Senate to pass legislation. The Coalition lost four seats and retained only 32 seats. The Greens gained three seats to 12. [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation|One Nation]] also remained steady with two seats, [[Centre Alliance]] and [[Rex Patrick Team]] each lost their Senate seats, while the [[Jacqui Lambie Network]] gained a second seat. [[David Pocock]] was elected as an independent senator on his [[David Pocock (political party)|own ticket]], and the [[United Australia Party (2013)|United Australia Party]] also gained one seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/results/senate|title=Senate Results|website=ABC News|access-date=22 June 2022|archive-date=13 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231113044217/https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/results/senate|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Composition of parliament===
{{see also|47th Parliament of Australia#Changes in membership}}
The [[47th Parliament of Australia|47th Parliament]] opened on 26 July 2022. The Liberal Party entered the parliament with a new leader, with former defence and home affairs minister [[Peter Dutton]] replacing the outgoing prime minister [[Scott Morrison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-30/peter-dutton-liberal-party-leader-sussan-ley-deputy/101109498|title=Peter Dutton elected new Liberal Party leader, Sussan Ley becomes deputy leader|date=30 May 2022|website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|author=Hitch, Georgia|access-date=30 May 2022|archive-date=30 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220530171734/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-30/peter-dutton-liberal-party-leader-sussan-ley-deputy/101109498|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 23 December 2022, [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] MP for [[Division of Calare|Calare]] [[Andrew Gee (politician)|Andrew Gee]] left the party and became an Independent, following the party's decision to publicly oppose an [[Indigenous Voice to Parliament]]. This meant that the Crossbench increased to 17 seats with the Coalition decreasing to 57 seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/23/nationals-mp-andrew-gee-quits-party-citing-opposition-to-indigenous-voice|title=Nationals MP Andrew Gee quits party citing its opposition to Indigenous voice|date=23 December 2022|website=[[The Guardian]]|author=Paul Karp|access-date=23 December 2022|archive-date=4 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404083907/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/23/nationals-mp-andrew-gee-quits-party-citing-opposition-to-indigenous-voice|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 16 January 2023, Liberal senator [[Jim Molan]] died; he was replaced by [[Maria Kovacic]] in May that year.

On 6 February 2023, [[Australian Greens|Greens]] senator [[Lidia Thorpe]] resigned from the party to sit as an [[Independent politician|independent]].

On 1 April 2023, Labor's [[Mary Doyle]] won the [[2023 Aston by-election]] following the resignation of sitting Liberal MP [[Alan Tudge]]. The result was considered a major [[Upset (competition)|upset]] and marked the first time that an incumbent government had won a seat from the Opposition since the [[1920 Kalgoorlie by-election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-01/byelection-result-aston-melbourne-labor-win/102157990|title=Labor snatches historic victory in Aston by-election in Melbourne's outer east|website=ABC News|access-date=1 April 2023|archive-date=13 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413063618/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-01/byelection-result-aston-melbourne-labor-win/102157990|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result, Labor increased their number of seats in the House of Representatives to 78, while the Coalition decreased to 56.

In May 2023, incumbent [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] MP [[Stuart Robert]] resigned, triggering [[2023 Fadden by-election|another by-election]], this time in the seat of [[Division of Fadden|Fadden]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. The seat was won by Liberal National candidate [[Cameron Caldwell]], keeping the composition of the parliament unchanged. Also in May 2023, [[Dai Le]], the independent member for the seat of [[Division of Fowler|Fowler]] in [[Greater Western Sydney|Western Sydney]], formed her own political party, the [[Dai Le and Frank Carbone Network]], alongside [[Frank Carbone (politician)|Frank Carbone]], the [[City of Fairfield#Mayor|Mayor of Fairfield]]. The party will be primarily based in Western Sydney.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/14/independent-mp-dai-le-looks-to-spin-success-in-western-sydney-into-new-political-movement | title=Independent MP Dai le looks to spin success in western Sydney into new political movement &#124; Sydney &#124; the Guardian | access-date=18 May 2023 | archive-date=18 May 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518045253/https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/14/independent-mp-dai-le-looks-to-spin-success-in-western-sydney-into-new-political-movement | url-status=live }}</ref>

On 15 June 2023, Liberal senator [[David Van]] was expelled from the party following sexual misconduct allegations by former LNP senator [[Amanda Stoker]] and Independent senator [[Lidia Thorpe]], continuing his term as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]]. On 14 November 2023, following a party preselection defeat, Liberal MP [[Russell Broadbent]] left the party to sit on the crossbench.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-14/russell-broadbent-quits-liberal-party-after-preselection-loss/103102336 |title=Outspoken backbencher Russell Broadbent quits Liberal Party after preselection loss |newspaper=ABC News |date=14 November 2023 |access-date=14 November 2023 |archive-date=14 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231114020720/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-14/russell-broadbent-quits-liberal-party-after-preselection-loss/103102336 |url-status=live }}</ref> November also saw [[Dave Sharma]] return to parliament, this time as a Liberal Senator, after the resignation of party veteran [[Marise Payne]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-09-08 |title='A grand contribution': Former minister and Liberal stalwart Marise Payne to quit politics |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-08/liberal-senator-marise-payne-to-retire-from-politics/102165366 |access-date=2024-10-17 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU |archive-date=7 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007184834/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-08/liberal-senator-marise-payne-to-retire-from-politics/102165366 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Remeikis |first=Amy |date=2023-11-26 |title=Moderate Dave Sharma wins NSW Liberal Senate spot after beating both Peter Dutton-endorsed candidates |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/26/moderate-dave-sharma-wins-nsw-liberal-senate-spot-after-beating-both-peter-dutton-endorsed-candidates |access-date=2024-10-17 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=26 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231126071151/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/26/moderate-dave-sharma-wins-nsw-liberal-senate-spot-after-beating-both-peter-dutton-endorsed-candidates |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 4 December 2023, Labor MP [[Peta Murphy]] died of cancer, reducing Labor to 77 seats, though the party's share was restored to 78 seats on 2 March 2024, when candidate [[Jodie Belyea]] retained the seat of [[Division of Dunkley|Dunkley]] at the [[2024 Dunkley by-election|by-election]]. Similarly the Liberal Party fell by one seat on 28 February 2024, when former prime minister and MP [[Scott Morrison]] resigned from the seat of [[Division of Cook|Cook]], though Liberal candidate [[Simon Kennedy]] retained the seat for the party at the [[2024 Cook by-election]].

Labor senator [[Pat Dodson]] resigned from the Senate in January 2024 while undergoing cancer treatment; his vacancy was filled by [[Varun Ghosh]]. Labor senator [[Linda White (politician)|Linda White]] died in March 2024 and was replaced by [[Lisa Darmanin (politician)|Lisa Darmanin]], while Greens senator [[Janet Rice]] resigned the following month and was replaced by [[Steph Hodgins-May]]. Party-compositional changes occurred when Tasmanian senator [[Tammy Tyrrell]] quit the [[Jacqui Lambie Network]] to sit as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] on 28 March 2024, and Labor senator [[Fatima Payman]] left the party and joined the crossbench as an independent in July 2024, citing disagreement with the party's position concerning the [[Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip|Israel-Gaza conflict]]. Three months later Payman established [[Australia's Voice]] party, stating she intended the party to field candidates in both houses of parliament at this election. The Senate composition changed once again on 25 August 2024 when LNP senator [[Gerard Rennick]] resigned from the party and moved to the crossbench to sit as an independent following a preselection defeat. Like Payman, he too announced his intention to establish a political party, named the [[People First Party (Australia)|People First Party]], in order to have his name featured above the line on the election ballot paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/26/gerard-rennick-quits-lnp-liberal-national-launch-people-first-party|title=Gerard Rennick quits LNP and reveals plan to register 'People First' party|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2024}}</ref> On 28 January 2025, Liberal senator [[Simon Birmingham]] resigned from parliament. The following week, on 6 February 2025, [[Leah Blyth]] was appointed to the Senate as his replacement.

Two lower house seats were left vacant prior to the election. Liberal National MP [[Keith Pitt]], who sat in the Nationals party-room, resigned from the seat of [[Division of Hinkler|Hinkler]] on 19 January 2025, and the following day Labor MP [[Bill Shorten]] departed from the seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]]. With their resignations occurring sufficiently close to the federal election, by-elections were not held.

===Events of the 47th Parliament===
{{See also|47th Parliament of Australia#Major events and legislation}}
As of April 2025, both major parties have retained their leaders throughout the duration of the 47th Parliament, with Anthony Albanese expected to have served one full term as Prime Minister and a second consecutive term as leader of the Labor Party, while Peter Dutton is on track to complete his first full term as Opposition Leader and leader of the Liberal Party. The [[Albanese ministry]] was reshuffled in July 2024, followed by a minor reshuffle in January 2025, while the [[shadow ministry of Peter Dutton]] was reshuffled in April 2023, March 2024, and January 2025.

The [[2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum]] featured prominently in political discourse during the first half of the parliamentary term. First proposed in the 2017 ''[[Uluru Statement from the Heart]]'', an [[Indigenous Voice to Parliament]] was supported by the Labor Party as part of its 2022 election platform. The 'Yes' campaign in support of the Voice initially attracted some bipartisan support, including Coalition figures such as the aforementioned Andrew Gee, former Minister for Indigenous Australians [[Ken Wyatt]], and then-Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians [[Julian Leeser]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Trent |date=2023-04-11 |title=Indigenous voice opposition has cost the Liberals Julian Leeser and Ken Wyatt.

Newly elected Country Liberal Party Senator [[Jacinta Nampijinpa Price]], who succeeded Leeser as Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, took on a prominent role in the 'No' campaign.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-05-02 |title='No regrets': Jacinta Nampijinpa Price reflects on being the face of the Voice No campaign |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-03/jacinta-nampijinpa-price-voice-referendum-no-campaign-reflection/103779330 |access-date=2024-12-06 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU |archive-date=22 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241122005613/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-03/jacinta-nampijinpa-price-voice-referendum-no-campaign-reflection/103779330 |url-status=live }}</ref> In August 2023, Albanese announced the referendum would be held on 14 October 2023. 60% of voters, including a majority in all six states, voted against the proposed constitutional changes.

The [[death and state funeral of Elizabeth II]], the long-serving head of state of Australia and other Commonwealth realms, took place in September 2022, followed by the [[coronation of Charles III and Camilla]] in May 2023. Charles [[2024 royal tour of Australia|visited Australia in October 2024]], the first visit by a ruling monarch since 2011. Independent Senator [[Lidia Thorpe]], who had resigned from the Greens in February 2023 over disagreements regarding the proposed Voice to Parliament, attracted significant media attention for shouting at Charles during an event at Parliament House in Canberra.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Not my King, Australian senator Lidia Thorpe shouts at Charles |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n20r750po |access-date=2024-12-06 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[Israel–Hamas war protests in Australia]] began in October 2023; responses to the war, particularly among local [[Australian Jews|Jewish]] and [[Islam in Australia|Muslim]] communities, were perceived as a significant threat to peaceful discourse in Australia. Incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia also increased, prompting the government to appoint three "special envoys": in July 2024, [[Jillian Segal]] as Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism, and Labor MP [[Peter Khalil]] as Special Envoy for Social Cohesion; and in September 2024, [[Aftab Malik]] as Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-29 |title=Australia appoints social cohesion envoy to ease community tensions |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-appoints-social-cohesion-envoy-to-ease-community-tensions-/7716795.html |access-date=2024-12-06 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-09-30 |title=Islamophobia envoy Aftab Malik appointed after months of delay |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/islamophobia-envoy-aftab-malik-appointed/104414330 |access-date=2024-12-06 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU |archive-date=1 February 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250201035736/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/islamophobia-envoy-aftab-malik-appointed/104414330 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Climate change also remained a prominent issue, partly due to the impact of natural disasters, including the [[2022 south eastern Australia floods]] and the [[2023–24 Australian bushfire season]], which led to seven deaths and ten deaths respectively, as well as [[Cyclone Jasper]] and [[Cyclone Alfred (2025)|Cyclone Alfred]], which caused significant property damage on the eastern coast in December 2023 and March 2025 respectively.

Changes to government infrastructure included: the establishment of the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Australia)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]] in July 2023; the launch of the [[Housing Australia Future Fund]] in November 2023;<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-09-14 |url-status=live |archive-date=31 March 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250331071236/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-14/housing-australia-future-fund-passes-parliament/102844098 |title=Government's $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund passes parliament |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-14/housing-australia-future-fund-passes-parliament/102844098 |first=Stephanie |last=Borys |access-date=2024-12-06 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU}}</ref> the replacement of the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]] with the [[Administrative Review Tribunal]] in October 2024; and the passage of the [[Online Safety Amendment]] Bill in November 2024.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Reuters]] |date=29 November 2024 |title=Australia passes social media ban for children under 16 |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/ |access-date=6 April 2025 |first1=Byron |last1=Kaye |last2=Menon |first2=Praveen |first3=Supantha |last3=Mukherjee |last4=Chaven-Dreyfuss |first4=Gertrude |location=Sydney, Stockholm, New York |editor-first1=Alasdair |editor-last1=Pal |editor-last2=Paul |editor-first2=Sonali |editor-first3=Deepa |editor-last3=Babington |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241129011231/https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/ |archive-date=29 November 2024}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
Members of the House of Representatives are elected by full [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. Each [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|electorate]] elects one member.

Senators are elected by [[proportional representation]] using [[single transferable vote]]. In states, senators are elected from state-wide twelve-member districts (although in most cases only six seats are contested at a single election), and in territories from territory-wide two-member districts.

Ballots are counted at least twice, at the polling place and, starting Monday night after election day, at counting centres.<ref name="aec-house">{{Cite web |title=House of Representatives count |url=https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/hor.htm |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Australian Electoral Commission |language=en-AU |archive-date=16 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250116113024/https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/hor.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="aec-sen">{{Cite web |title=The Senate counting process |url=https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/senate.htm |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Australian Electoral Commission |language=en-AU |archive-date=21 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250121012822/https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/senate.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Redistribution===
{{see also|Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|Redistribution (Australia)}}
The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] is required, one year after the first sitting day for a new House of Representatives, to determine the number of members to which each State and Territory is entitled. If the number in any state changes, a redistribution will be required in those states. A redistribution will be postponed if it would begin within one year of the expiration of the House of Representatives.

The apportionment determination was made in July 2023 based on the population figures for December 2022. The determination resulted in a reduction of one seat in New South Wales to 46, a reduction of one seat in Victoria to 38 and an increase of one seat in Western Australia to 16. The total number of seats in the House of Representatives will decrease from 151 to 150 at the 2025 federal election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2023/07-27.htm|title=House of Representatives to return to 150 members|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|date=27 July 2023|access-date=18 October 2023|archive-date=20 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231020115418/https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2023/07-27.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May and June 2024, the Australian Electoral Commission released its draft proposals for electorate changes, recommending the creation of the [[Division of Bullwinkel]] (Western Australia) in the outer eastern suburbs of [[Perth]], and the abolition of the [[Division of Higgins]] (Victoria) in Melbourne's inner south-east (held by Labor's [[Michelle Ananda-Rajah]]) and the [[Division of North Sydney]] (New South Wales) in Sydney's inner north-east (held by [[teal independent]] [[Kylea Tink]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-aec-has-redrawn-the-boundaries-for-federal-seats-how-will-this-affect-the-next-election-232602|title=The AEC has redrawn the boundaries for federal seats.

A redistribution was due in Tasmania in November 2024, due to it being seven years since the day of the last determination in the state, however this was deferred as it would occur within one year of the expiration of the House of Representatives. The redistribution will instead commence within 30 days after the first sitting day of the new House of Representatives in the 48th Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/redistributions/2024/tas/|title=Tasmanian redistribution|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|access-date=22 January 2025}}</ref>

===Choice of election date===
On 5 September 2024, during the announcement by [[Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme|NDIS]] and [[Minister for Government Services|government services]] minister [[Bill Shorten]] of his impending retirement from politics, Prime Minister [[Anthony Albanese]] suggested that he may schedule the election to be held at a date later than Shorten's departure from Parliament in February 2025, while noting that the election was due by May 2025.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/sep/05/australia-news-live-rba-reserve-bank-interest-rates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-jim-chalmers-labor-coalition?CMP=share_btn_url&page=with%3Ablock-66d908ee8f081743e33b5ac9#block-66d908ee8f081743e33b5ac9|at=Albanese says there may be a gap between Shorten retiring and new member being elected|work=[[Guardian Australia|The Guardian]]|date=5 September 2024|access-date=5 September 2024|title=Severe weather warnings for parts of NSW and Victoria – as it happened|archive-date=5 September 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240905023315/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/sep/05/australia-news-live-rba-reserve-bank-interest-rates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-jim-chalmers-labor-coalition?CMP=share_btn_url&page=with%3Ablock-66d908ee8f081743e33b5ac9#block-66d908ee8f081743e33b5ac9|url-status=live|first1=Nino|last1=Bucci|first2=Emily|last2=Wind}}</ref>

Consideration had to be given to the [[2025 Western Australian state election|Western Australian state election]] scheduled on 8 March 2025. Holding the federal election on that day would require the state election to be rescheduled to the following Saturday.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-13/wa-state-election-2025-possible-date-change/104592724|first1=Courtney|last1=Withers|last2=Shine|first2=Rhiannon|first3=Nicolas|last3=Perpitch|title=WA Premier Roger Cook examining possible contingency plans in case of federal election date clash|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=13 November 2024|access-date=7 March 2025|archive-date=7 March 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250307192211/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-13/wa-state-election-2025-possible-date-change/104592724|url-status=live}}</ref> Having the state and federal elections too close to each other was also not desirable. To prevent the campaigns for the state and federal elections from clashing, the federal election would ideally have to be called after the state election. Accounting for the minimum 33 day campaign period, the earliest possible date for the election would then have been 12 April 2025.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-12/federal-election-speculation-tasmania-candidates/104590156|first1=Jacob|last1=Greber|last2=Littler|first2=Ruby|work=ABC News|date=12 November 2024|access-date=12 November 2024|title=Early election speculation hits a fever pitch as Albanese announces Tasmania candidates, deflects WA clash}}</ref> Calling the election in early March for that date would have required the [[2025 Australian federal budget]] scheduled for 25 March to be postponed to after the election.

Concurrent with increasing media speculation in the first week of March 2025 that Albanese might call the federal election for 12 April,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Daniel |last2=Branco |first2=Jorge |date=5 March 2025 |title=There are only three possible federal election dates left.

On 7 March, Albanese announced he had ruled out a 12 April election, and his government would deliver the budget on 25 March as scheduled. This was to prevent the need for Albanese to leave the recovery zone for Canberra to call the election, and to also prevent the announcement and start of an election campaign from clashing with dealing with the cyclone and recovery efforts.<ref>{{cite web |last=Norman |first=Jane |date=7 March 2025 |title=Anthony Albanese rules out April election, with federal budget set for later this month |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-07/federal-government-to-hand-down-budget/105024394 |access-date=7 March 2025 |work=ABC News}}</ref> With the following April Saturdays of 19 April and 26 April coinciding with significant nationwide [[long weekend]]s, i.e., the [[Easter]] and [[Anzac Day]] public holidays, holding an election on those days would likely be problematic and unpopular. That left the Saturdays of 3 May, 10 May or 17 May as the only remaining possible dates. Though, out of these, 3 May coincides with a long weekend in [[Queensland]] and the [[Northern Territory]] for [[Labour Day]] and [[May Day]], respectively.

Ahead of the 2025 federal budget, there was speculation that Albanese would call the election either on the Friday or Sunday following the budget, with potential dates being 3 May or 10 May. This speculation intensified when rumours circulated that Albanese might announce the election as early as Friday 28 March, for one of these dates. On Thursday 27 March, the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet]] accidentally posted, then deleted, a message to social media platform [[Twitter|X]], referring to the government being in "[[Caretaker government of Australia|caretaker mode]]". This immediately fuelled speculation that the election would be called the very next morning.
