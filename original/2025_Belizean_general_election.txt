At the beginning of 2025, Prime Minister [[Johnny Briceño]] indicated that elections would be called in the first half of the year.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-08 |title=When Will the General Election Be? |url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/when-will-the-general-election-be/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Channel 5 Belize |language=en}}</ref> In February, Trinidadian senior counsel and former Attorney General, [[Anand Ramlogan]], formally requested on behalf of his clients that the government refrain from calling an election until it carried out a redistricting exercise.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-08 |title=Will 2025 General Election Follow Redistricting Exercise? |url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/will-2025-general-election-follow-redistricting-exercise/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Channel 5 Belize |language=en}}</ref> On 11 February, Briceño called the elections for 12 March, with Nominations Day on 24 February.<ref name=":0" /> The Writ of Election was formally filed by the [[Governor-General of Belize|Governor-General]] immediately afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-11 |title=Governor-General Proclaims March 12 as General Election Date |url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/governor-general-proclaims-march-12-as-general-election-date/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Channel 5 Belize |language=en}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Belize|High Court]] later dismissed the claim, allowing the election to proceed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-19 |title=Case Dismissed!

==Candidates==
=== People's United Party ===
The ruling [[People's United Party|PUP]] sought to form the next government after having won a landslide 26 seats in 2020. Incumbent Prime Minister [[Johnny Briceño]] of [[Orange Walk Central]] lead the PUP into his second election as party leader. The PUP had won 65 out of 67 municipal seats in the [[2021 Belizean municipal elections|2021 municipal elections]] and defended 61 of them in [[2024 Belizean municipal elections|2024]]. The PUP was also victorious in the two parliamentary by-elections that took place following the 2020 election. [[Elvia Vega-Samos]] successfully held [[Corozal Bay (Belize House constituency)|Corozal Bay]] in the 3 March 2021 by-election following the death of her brother, David Vega, from COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-03-04 |title=BREAKING: Elvia Vega declares victory in Corozal Bay by-election |url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2021/03/03/breaking-elvia-vega-declares-victory-in-corozal-bay-by-election1/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Breaking Belize News |language=en}}</ref> Osmond Martinez also held [[Toledo East]] in the 17 July 2024 by-election following the death of Michael Espat.<ref>{{Cite web  |date=2024-07-18 |title=Dr Osmond Martinez wins Toledo East by-election |url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2024/07/17/dr-osmond-martinez-wins-toledo-east-by-election/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Breaking Belize News |language=en}}</ref>

For the first time in Belize's history, two of the PUP's candidates, Anthony Mahler of [[Pickstock (Belize House constituency)|Pickstock]] and Henry Charles Usher of [[Fort George (Belize House constituency)|Fort George]], were automatically declared the winner of their respective divisions due to the lack of challengers on Nominations Day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Uncontested Elections in Pickstock and Fort George as Mahler and Usher Secure Another Term |url=https://lovefm.com/uncontested-elections-in-pickstock-and-fort-george-as-mahler-and-usher-secure-another-term/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Love FM |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== United Democratic Party ===
Following a landslide loss in 2020, the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] faced turbulent circumstances in opposition. The UDP held on to only two municipal seats in the 2021 municipal elections while also losing the Corozal Bay by-election on the same day. Party Leader [[Patrick Faber (politician)|Patrick Faber]] of [[Collet (Belize House constituency)|Collet]] was temporarily stripped of his role as [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]] and replaced with [[Shyne Barrow|Moses "Shyne" Barrow]] of [[Mesopotamia (Belize House constituency)|Mesopotamia]] after a video of what appeared to be Faber involved in a domestic dispute surfaced online. Faber was reinstated as Leader of the Opposition after a recall convention failed to meet the necessary two-thirds majority to remove him from his post.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-17 |title=Hon. Patrick Faber reinstated as Leader of the Opposition |url=https://www.sanpedrosun.com/politics-and-government/2021/09/17/hon-patrick-faber-reinstated-as-leader-of-the-opposition/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=The San Pedro Sun |language=en}}</ref> However, in January 2022, Faber's fiancée alleged to the police that Faber had assaulted her at his home. The charges were withdrawn two days later, but several members of the UDP including the party chairman called on Faber to resign his post as party leader. Faber resigned on 24 January.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-01-24 |title=Faber resigns as L.O.O. and UDP leader |url=https://www.thereporter.bz/post/faber-resigns-as-l-o-o-and-udp-leader |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=The Reporter |language=en}}</ref>

The UDP held a leadership convention to elect a new leader on 27 March 2022. Moses "Shyne" Barrow and [[Tracy Panton]] of [[Albert (Belize House constituency)|Albert]] both ran for the position with Barrow emerging victorious by three votes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-28 |title=Belize: Former rapper Shyne Barrow, elected party leader of UDP |url=https://caribbean.loopnews.com/content/belize-former-rapper-shyne-barrow-elected-party-leader-udp |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Loop News |language=en}}</ref> Turmoil persisted within the UDP following Barrow's election as party leader. Barrow was criticized internally for the UDP's poor showing in both the 2024 municipal elections where they only won six municipal seats and the Toledo East by-election. Following Barrow's decision to remove the standard bearers of the [[Port Loyola]] and [[Caribbean Shores]] divisions, several UDP standard bearers led a recall petition to oust Barrow from his position.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-28 |title=Alliance for Democracy Submits Petition for Shyne Barrow's Recall |url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/alliance-for-democracy-submits-petition-for-shyne-barrows-recall/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Channel 5 Belize |language=en}}</ref> Despite claiming to have collected the necessary signatures, UDP chairman [[Michael Peyrefitte]] denied the recall petition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-28 |title=UDP Chairman Rejects Recall Petition |url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/udp-chairman-rejects-recall-petition/ |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Channel 5 Belize |language=en}}</ref> UDP members opposed to Barrow declared Panton to be the interim leader of the party following a convention in October 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-23 |title=Hon.

While Barrow remained Leader of the Opposition, the UDP was essentially splintered going into the election with both Barrow and Panton claiming to be the true leader of the UDP. A total of 41 candidates were nominated under the UDP banner on Nominations Day running for only 27 out of the 31 divisions.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2025-02-25 |title=Notice that a poll will be taken |url=https://elections.gov.bz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NOTICE-THAT-A-POLL-WILL-BE-TAKEN-3.pdf |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Elections and Boundaries Department}}</ref> Twenty-five candidates were nominated by Barrow, and fifteen candidates were nominated by Panton. The remaining candidate, [[Anthony Martinez (politician)|Anthony "Boots" Martinez]] in [[Port Loyola]], did not align with either faction. All candidates running under the UDP were denoted with the colour red on the ballot.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-27 |title=Panton Supports E.B.C.
