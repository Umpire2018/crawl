The '''2025 Canadian federal election''' will be held on April 28 to elect members of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] to the [[45th Canadian Parliament]]. The [[writs of election]] were issued on March 23, 2025, after Governor General [[Mary Simon]] accepted a request to [[Dissolution of parliament in Canada|dissolve parliament]] from Prime Minister [[Mark Carney]].

This will be the first election to use a new [[2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution|343-seat electoral map]] based on the [[2021 Canadian census]].

===Electoral system===
Canada's [[electoral system]], a "[[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]" system, is formally referred to as a single-member plurality system. Voters select a representative nominated for their [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] (sometimes referred to as a ''riding''), and the candidate with more votes than any other candidate is elected to a seat in the 343-member House of Commons and represents that riding as its [[member of Parliament]] (MP). The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms government, with that party's leader becoming [[Prime Minister (Canada)|prime minister]]. The largest party by seat count that is not the government or part of a governing coalition becomes the Official Opposition. That party receives more finances and privileges than the other opposition parties.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Official Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons |first=Jay |last=Makarenko |date=January 30, 2008 |website=re:politics |url=https://repolitics.com/features/the-official-opposition-in-the-canadian-house-of-commons/ |access-date=March 27, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Selection and Role of Canada's Official Opposition |first=Susan |last=Munroe |date=February 27, 2019 |website=ThoughtCo |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/official-opposition-508467 |access-date=March 27, 2025}}</ref>

An absolute majority of the votes cast in the last election is not needed to form government and is rarely achieved. Additionally, the government party does not need to obtain a majority of the seats in the House of Commons; under the current multi-party system, it is common for the government party to lack a majority. However, to pass bills, the governing party must have support of a majority of MPs. Without majority support, the government can be defeated, then a new party is named government or an election has to be held.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

====Redistribution====

This will be the first election contested under the new electoral districts established in the 2022 redistribution. Consequently, media outlets tend to report seat gains and losses as compared to [[Notional election results|notional results]]. These are the results if all votes cast in 2021 were unchanged but regrouped by new electoral district boundaries, as published by [[Elections Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elections.ca/res/rep/tra/2023rep/tra_2023_a_e.pdf |title=Transposition of Votes from the 44th General Election to the 2023 Representation Orders |date=April 2024 |website=elections.ca |publisher=[[Elections Canada]] |access-date=April 10, 2024}}</ref>

On April 1, 2025, the Commission announced that it had invited the leaders of the Bloc Québécois, Conservative Party, Green Party, Liberal Party, and New Democratic Party to the debates.

On April 15, the leaders of the Bloc Québécois and the NDP suggested rescheduling the French language debate because of the debate coinciding with the final [[ice hockey|hockey]] game of the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' regular season, after it became clear the game would decide whether the Canadiens would make the [[2025 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]]. The Commission declined to reschedule the debate to a different day, but agreed to move the start time two hours earlier to 6:00 pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/11132946/canada-election-leaders-debate-french-postponement-montreal-canadiens-game/ |title=French election debate time moved to avoid Montreal Canadiens game conflict |first=Sean |last=Previl |work=[[Global News]] |date=April 15, 2025 |access-date=April 16, 2025}}</ref>
