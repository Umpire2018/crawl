==Background==
The [[2021 Caymanian general election|2021 elections]] saw independent candidates win 12 seats and the [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] (PPM) win seven. A government was formed by independent [[Wayne Panton]], who became [[Premier of the Cayman Islands|Premier]]. In November 2023, twelve MPs joined the new [[United People's Movement (Cayman Islands)|United People's Movement]] (UMP), with its leader [[Julianna O'Connor-Connolly]] becoming Premier. On 31 October 2024, four UPM MPs resigned from government, resulting in it losing its majority in parliament. In February and March 2025, three of seven members of the minority UPM government including O'Connor-Connolly joined PPM to seek re-election.<ref>{{cite web |title=O’Connor-Connolly returns to fold as PPM confirms Kenneth Bryan as deputy leader |url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2025/03/01/oconnor-connolly-returns-to-fold-as-ppm-confirms-kenneth-bryan-as-deputy-leader/ |website=Cayman Compass |access-date=13 March 2025 |date=1 March 2025}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The [[Parliament of the Cayman Islands|Parliament]] has 21 members. Nineteen members are directly elected by [[first-past-the-post voting]] from single-member constituencies, for a four-year term. Two ''ex officio'' (appointed) members are the Deputy Governor and the Attorney-General, who are appointed by the [[Governor of the Cayman Islands|Governor]].<ref name="o2015">[https://caymannewsservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Nineteen-Single-Member-Electoral-Districts-Boundaries-Order-2015.pdf The Nineteen Single Member Electoral Districts Boundaries Order, 2015]</ref>

==Contesting parties==
The UPM has stated that it will not contest the 2025 elections and will dissolve. The four former members of the UPM formed a new political party, the Caymanian Community Party (TCCP), headed by [[André Ebanks]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whittaker |first1=James |title=After latest government collapse, what happens now? |url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2024/10/31/after-latest-government-collapse-what-happens-now/ |website=Cayman Compass |publisher=Cayman Compass |access-date=13 February 2025}}</ref>

The opposition PPM will contest the elections with [[Joey Hew]] as its leader following resignations of Speaker and former Premier [[Alden McLaughlin]] and former Deputy Premier [[Moses Kirkconnell]].

The Cayman Islands National Party is a new party formed by Dan Scott, a former regional managing partner at [[Ernst & Young]].
