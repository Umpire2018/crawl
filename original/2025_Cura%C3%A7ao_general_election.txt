{{Politics of Curaçao}}
General elections were held in [[Curaçao]] on 21 March 2025 to elect the 21 members of the [[Parliament of Curaçao]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 January 2024 |title=Curaçao elections scheduled for March 21, 2025 |url=https://www.curacaochronicle.com/post/main/curacao-elections-scheduled-for-march-21-2025/ |access-date=9 December 2024 |work=Curaçao Chronicle}}</ref> 

The governing party [[Movement for the Future of Curaçao]] (MFK) came in the lead and won an absolute majority with 13 seats, a first in the island's history. 

== Background ==
The [[2021 Curaçao general election|2021 general elections]] led to a change in government. The outgoing coalition suffered a major defeat, with the [[Real Alternative Party]] (PAR) and the [[New Antilles Movement]] (MAN) losing many of their seats, while the National Innovation Party (PIN) lost all representation in parliament. From the opposition, the pro-independence party [[Movement for the Future of Curaçao]] (MFK) was the first place finisher, winning almost half of the seats.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=24 March 2025 |date=20 March 2021 |language=en |title=A major shift in Curaçao politics: MFK biggest party |url=https://www.curacaochronicle.com/post/main/a-major-shift-in-curacao-politics-mfk-biggest-party/ |website=curacaochronicle.com}}<!-- auto-translated from French by Module:CS1 translator -->.</ref>
