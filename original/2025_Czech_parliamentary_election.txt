Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in the [[Czech Republic]] by October 2025. All 200 members of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]], will be elected and the leader of the resultant government will become the Prime Minister.

==Background==
The [[constitution of the Czech Republic]] stipulates that an election to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech parliament]], must be held every four years. The executive government is answerable to the Chamber of Deputies and remains in power only as long as it commands the confidence of the majority of its members. Article 19(1) of the constitution states that any [[Czech nationality law|citizen of the Czech Republic]] over the age of 21 years old is eligible to serve as a Member of Parliament.

The [[2021 Czech parliamentary election|2021 parliamentary elections]] saw the conservative alliance [[Spolu (Czech Republic)|Spolu]] (consisting of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS), [[KDU-ČSL]] and [[TOP 09]]) finish first with 27.8% of the vote. [[ANO (political party)|ANO]] finished second and liberal alliance [[Pirates and Mayors]] third. [[Freedom and Direct Democracy]] was the only other party to win seats. [[Spolu (Czech Republic)|Spolu]] formed a government with [[Pirates and Mayors]] with ODS leader Petr Fiala as Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

Soon after the 2021 elections, the leader of the Mayors and Independents, Vít Rakušan, said that his party would run in the next elections as a single party rather than continue their alliance with the Pirate Party. According to internal Pirate Party analysis, the Mayors violated their joint agreement by asking their voters to give their candidates preference votes on the joint list, which resulted in just four Pirate MPs being elected.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Czech government set to sign coalition deal|url=https://www.intellinews.com/new-czech-government-set-to-sign-coalition-deal-226157/|website=[[Bne IntelliNews]]|date=7 November 2021|access-date=23 January 2025}}</ref>

On 8 February 2023, Babiš announced he would limit his role within ANO. He would remain as an MP and the leader of the party, while [[Karel Havlíček (politician)|Karel Havlíček]] and [[Alena Schillerová]] would become the primary faces of the party, with Havlíček becoming leader of the [[shadow cabinet]].<ref name="Novinky 8 12 23">{{Cite web|first=Dáša|last=Šamanová|title=Babiš se stahuje do pozadí, předsedou ANO a poslancem přitom zůstává|url=https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/domaci-babis-zustava-poslancem-40422398 |website=[[Novinky.cz]]|access-date=8 February 2023|language=cs|publisher=Borgis}}</ref><ref name="iDNES 8 2 23">{{Cite news|first=Josef|last=Kopecký|title=Babiš povede ANO v pozadí, vidět budou Schillerová a šéf stínové vlády Havlíček|url=https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/vedeni-ano-prezidentska-volba-andrej-babis-poslanecky-mandat.A230208_060529_domaci_kop|newspaper=[[Mladá fronta Dnes]]|publisher=[[Mafra (company)|Mafra]]|date=8 February 2023|access-date=8 February 2023|language=cs}}</ref> Babiš described Havlíček as a future prime minister of the Czech Republic.<ref name="HN 090623">{{Cite news|first=Ondřej|last=Leinert|title=Babiš: Moje poslední volby?

=== 2024 European Parliament election ===
The [[2024 European Parliament election in the Czech Republic|2024 European Parliament election]] saw losses for the ruling parties, as the [[Czech Pirate Party]] lost two of its three seats, and both the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democrats]] and [[KDU-ČSL]] lost one [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] each. [[TOP 09]] retained both its mandates and [[Mayors and Independents]] gained one, resulting in a net loss of three seats for the ruling coalition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

Among the parliamentary opposition, [[ANO (political party)|ANO]] gained one mandate compared to the previous election, and [[Freedom and Direct Democracy|SPD]] lost one, just passing the parliamentary threshold. Most of the gains went to [[Populism|populist]] extra-parliamentary parties, with two MEPs each won by [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[Stačilo!]] and the right-wing populist [[Přísaha and Motorists]], whose leader [[Filip Turek (racing driver)|Filip Turek]] had faced [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazism]] allegations just days before the election. The election also saw the worst result ever for [[Social Democracy (Czech Republic)|Social Democracy]], which won just 1.8% of the vote, far below the threshold.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Tomáš|last=Svoboda|title=Volby ovládlo hnutí ANO, největšími skokany jsou Motoristé s Přísahou|url=https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/volby-eurovolby-volby-ovladlo-hnuti-ano-nejvetsimi-skokany-jsou-motoriste-s-prisahou-253551|website=[[Seznam Zprávy]]|date=9 June 2024|access-date=18 January 2025|language=cs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first1=Adam|last1=Musil|first2=Jakub|last2=Chodil|title=Eurovolby v Česku vyhrálo ANO.

=== 2024 regional and senate elections ===
The [[2024 Czech regional elections]] saw a near-total wipeout for the Pirate Party, the smallest party in the government coalition, which surpassed the threshold in just one out of 13 contested regions and lost all but four councillors nationwide. This led to the resignation of the party leadership and the party's departure from the [[Cabinet of Petr Fiala|Fiala cabinet]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Czech government undergoes a reshuffle after a party leaves but retains a majority in Parliament|url=https://apnews.com/article/czech-government-reshuffle-fiala-pirates-896ceaba8a6085498f7f4b40e252e54c|website=[[Associated Press]]|date=8 October 2024}}</ref> 

The election was also successful for the Stačilo! coalition, which entered 12 out of 13 regional assemblies, winning 40 councillors.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Blanka|last=Freiwilligová|title=Stačilo! bodovalo v 11 krajích.
