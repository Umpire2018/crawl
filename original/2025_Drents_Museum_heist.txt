On 25 January 2025, thieves broke into the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]], the Netherlands, with explosives and stole golden artifacts in a total value of around €6 million.<ref name=NOS26 /> These, which include the [[Helmet of Coțofenești]], with an estimated value of €4.3 million,<ref name=NOS26/> are irreplaceable archaeological treasures that represent the [[Dacians|Dacian civilization]], which thrived in present-day [[Romania]] before conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106 AD. Three gold bracelets from the Dacian royal collection were also stolen. The exhibition, which had never before been displayed internationally at this scale, included items such as ceremonial jewelry and religious objects dating back to the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 January 2025 |title=Ancient gold artifacts stolen in Drents museum robbery |url=https://nltimes.nl/2025/01/25/ancient-gold-artifacts-stolen-drents-museum-robbery |access-date=25 January 2025 |work=NL Times}}</ref>

[[Ministry of Culture (Romania)|Romania's Ministry of Culture]] has vowed to do everything possible to retrieve the artifacts, which had been on loan to the Drents Museum from the [[National History Museum of Romania]] in [[Bucharest]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Theft in Netherlands of ancient golden helmet leaves Romania distraught |url=https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-cotofenesti-helmet-heist-romania-0a6dbb8e742c0a5315244fc47761b7cb |publisher=[[AP News]] |date=28 January 2025}}</ref> {{ill|Harry Tupan|nl}}, director of the Drents Museum, expressed profound dismay at the theft, describing it as the most significant incident in the museum's 170-year history.<ref name=BBC/>

As a result, the Romanian minister of Culture [[Natalia Intotero]] fired the director of the National History Museum in Bucharest.

==Incident==
Police were alerted following reports of an explosion at 3:45 a.m. local time on 25 January.<ref name=BBC>{{Cite web |last=Aikman |first=Ian |date=26 January 2025 |title=Thieves use explosives to steal gold 'masterpieces' from Dutch museum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxkpnnlpdvo |access-date=28 January 2025 |website=BBC |language=en-GB |archive-date=27 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250127174856/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxkpnnlpdvo |url-status=live }}</ref> There was no guard in the museum at the time of the theft.<ref name=NOS26 /> Security camera footage at the site later revealed three hooded people carrying a duffle bag, a crowbar and flashlights before the explosion. The items stolen were part of the exhibition titled "Dacia: Empire of Gold and Silver", featuring archaeological treasures from museums across Romania that was scheduled to close on January 26.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wizovich |first=Eli |date=27 January 2025 |title=Art Thieves Blew Up a Dutch Museum's Door to Steal an Ancient Golden Helmet From Romania |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/art-thieves-blew-up-a-dutch-museums-door-to-steal-an-ancient-golden-helmet-from-romania-180985915/ |access-date=29 January 2025 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en-US |archive-date=28 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250128173216/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/art-thieves-blew-up-a-dutch-museums-door-to-steal-an-ancient-golden-helmet-from-romania-180985915/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Investigation==
Forensic teams and investigators examined the site and analyzed CCTV footage throughout the day. Authorities are also investigating a vehicle (dark gray [[Volkswagen Golf]]) found burning on a nearby road, suspecting it may have been connected to the crime.<ref name=BBC /> Next to that a [[Ford Transit]] was involved.<ref name=politie />

Dutch police said it was plausible "that the perpetrators switched vehicles after abandoning the burning car", and that multiple people were involved in the heist. [[Interpol]] was contacted to assist with the case.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tabachnick |first=Cara |date=25 January 2025 |title=Explosion rocks Dutch museum before gold masterpieces stolen: "This is a dark day" |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drents-museum-netherlands-gold-masterpieces-stolen/ |access-date=28 January 2025 |website=CBS News |language=en-US}}</ref>

After the robbery investigations were conducted in [[Alkmaar]], [[Witmarsum, Friesland|Witmarsum]], [[Groningen]], [[Assen]] and [[Rolde]]. In the television program ''{{ill|Opsporing Verzocht|nl}}'', appeals were made to the people.<ref name=NOS28 /> 

On January 27 a sledgehammer was found in the water on the museum grounds, which may have been used in the heist.<ref name=NOS27 />

On January 28 it was announced that the suspects are from [[North Holland]].<ref name=NOS28>{{Cite news |date=28 January 2025 |title=Verdachten kunstroof komen uit Noord-Holland, directeur Roemeens museum ontslagen |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2553649-verdachten-kunstroof-komen-uit-noord-holland-directeur-roemeens-museum-ontslagen |access-date=28 January 2025 |website=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |language=nl |archive-date=29 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250129092106/https://nos.nl/artikel/2553649-verdachten-kunstroof-komen-uit-noord-holland-directeur-roemeens-museum-ontslagen |url-status=live }}</ref> The following day, the Dutch police arrested three suspects in [[Heerhugowaard]], North Holland.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-29 |title=Drie aanhoudingen in Heerhugowaard in verband met kunstroof in Assen |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2553751-drie-aanhoudingen-in-heerhugowaard-in-verband-met-kunstroof-in-assen |access-date=2025-01-30 |website=nos.nl |language=nl}}</ref> They were tracked down after police found a bag that was left behind in a neighborhood in Assen, including clothes in it.<ref name=politie /> Due to the importance of finding the stolen pieces, the police released the identity and images of two of the three suspects on January 30, which is very uncommon in the Netherlands in case of already arrested suspects.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-30 |title= Gestolen kunstschatten nog spoorloos, politie toont foto's aangehouden verdachten |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/2553899-gestolen-kunstschatten-nog-spoorloos-politie-toont-foto-s-aangehouden-verdachten |access-date=2025-01-31|website=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]|language=nl}}</ref> The two identified suspects were Douglas Chelsey Wendersteyt and Bernard Zeeman both from [[Heerhugowaard]].
