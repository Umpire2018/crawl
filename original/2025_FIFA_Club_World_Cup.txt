FIFA approved the allocation of slots between confederations in February 2023 and announced the United States as the host country four months later. The [[FIFA Intercontinental Cup]] was established as an annual tournament using a very similar version of the old format.

The expansion of the tournament was met with criticism by players' union [[FIFPRO]] and the [[World Leagues Forum]] due to the impact it is expected to have on fixture congestion and player welfare.

Furthermore, a restriction of two clubs per association will be applied, with the exception of champion clubs if more than two clubs from the same association win their confederation's top club competition. The calculation method for the four-year club rankings within each confederation was based on the teams' performance in their respective continental tournaments during seasons completed between 2021 and 2024.<ref name="method">{{cite web |title=FIFA Club World Cup 2025: How teams qualify |url=https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/club-world-cup/usa-2025/articles/how-teams-qualify |publisher=FIFA |access-date=October 7, 2024 |date=August 19, 2024 |archive-date=October 7, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241007104244/https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/club-world-cup/usa-2025/articles/how-teams-qualify |url-status=live }}</ref>

For confederations other than UEFA, the method was as follows:<ref name="method"/>
*3 points for a win
*1 point for a draw
*3 points for successful progression to each new stage of the competition

In the case of UEFA, due to the existence of the well-established [[UEFA coefficient#Men's club coefficient|UEFA club coefficient]] system, the method used by UEFA to calculate the club coefficient was "exceptionally applied" to rank the European teams.<ref name="method"/>{{refn|group=note|name=UEFA coefficient|However, the system was only applied over the four years, instead of the usual five, to the Champions League exclusively.}}

FIFA compiled the draw pots as follows, with teams ranked within each confederation based on FIFA's club ranking system:<ref name="rankings"/>
* Pot 1: The four top-ranked teams from both UEFA and CONMEBOL
* Pot 2: The remaining eight teams from UEFA
* Pot 3: The two top-ranked teams from each of AFC, CAF and CONCACAF, and the remaining two teams from CONMEBOL
* Pot 4: The remaining teams from AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, OFC and host country

In the draw, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group. Additionally, no two UEFA teams from the same national association could be drawn into the same group.

To maintain competitive balance, two separate pathways of four groups were established for the knockout stage. They were composed as follows:
* Pathway 1: Winners of Groups A, C, E and G, paired with the runners-up of Groups B, D, F and H
* Pathway 2: Winners of Groups B, D, F and H, paired with the runners-up of Groups A, C, E and G

Given these pathways, UEFA and CONMEBOL teams faced the following constraints in the draw:
* UEFA teams ranked 1–2 and CONMEBOL teams ranked 1–2 were allocated to separate pathways, prevented from meeting until the semi-finals should they win their groups
* UEFA teams ranked 3–4 and CONMEBOL teams ranked 3–4 were allocated to separate pathways, prevented from meeting until the semi-finals should they win their groups
* UEFA teams ranked 1–4 were drawn into groups that will prevent them meeting until the semi-finals should they win their groups
* CONMEBOL teams ranked 1–4 were drawn into groups that will prevent them meeting until the semi-finals should they win their groups
* UEFA teams ranked 5–8 were drawn into groups with CONMEBOL teams ranked 1–4
* UEFA teams ranked 9–12 were drawn into groups with UEFA teams ranked 1–4

As teams from the host country and for scheduling purposes, [[Inter Miami CF]] and [[Seattle Sounders FC]] were drawn into position 4 of Groups A and B, respectively. Consequently, teams drawn into Groups A and B were allocated to the position corresponding to their draw pot.

The draw started with Pot 1 and ended with Pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically, based on the draw constraints. For Groups C to H, the position for the team within the group was then drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the Pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.

The draw pots were as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/41ecaf295251d7c8/original/Draw-Procedures-for-the-FIFA-Club-World-Cup-2025.pdf |title=Draw Procedures for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=December 3, 2024 |access-date=December 3, 2024}}</ref>

===Training bases===

According to a report from ''[[The Athletic]]'', FIFA has designated sites in host cities for team training bases with priority given to clubs that have more matches in the area. Clubs were permitted to independently negotiate with other facility owners and operators, including several college athletic programs, to secure their own base. Several facilities are also designated by FIFA for use later in the tournament by qualified teams in the knockout rounds.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crafton |first=Adam |date=March 12, 2025 |title=FIFA, the Club World Cup and the scrap for US training bases among major clubs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6195796/2025/03/12/fifa-club-world-cup-training-bases-usa-clubs/ |work=The Athletic |url-access=subscription |accessdate=March 12, 2025}}</ref>

==Match officials==
On April 14, 2025, FIFA confirmed that 117 match officials from 41 member associations would be selected for the tournament. This included 35 referees, 58 assistant referees, and 24 video match officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://inside.fifa.com/refereeing/news/match-officials-appointed-landmark-club-world-cup-2025 |title=Match officials appointed for landmark FIFA Club World Cup 2025 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=April 14, 2025 |access-date=April 14, 2025 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/7f4d476ed23d02df/original/FIFA-Club-World-Cup-2025-List-of-appointed-FIFA-Match-Officials.pdf |title=FIFA Club World Cup 2025 – List of Appointed FIFA Match Officials |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=April 14, 2025 |access-date=April 14, 2025 }}</ref>

==Criticism==

===Impact of added fixtures===
The proposed expansion was criticized by [[FIFPRO]], a global union of professional players, as well as the [[World Leagues Forum]], which represents professional leagues; both organizations raised concerns about player welfare due to the added fixtures in an already congested playing calendar.<ref>{{cite news |last=Grohmann |first=Karolos |date=December 16, 2022 |title=Club World Cup to feature 32 teams in 2025, says FIFA president Infantino |url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/club-world-cup-feature-32-teams-2025-says-fifa-president-infantino-2022-12-16/ |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=December 18, 2022 |archive-date=March 21, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321202429/https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/club-world-cup-feature-32-teams-2025-says-fifa-president-infantino-2022-12-16/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="newformat"/> The Spanish top division league, [[La Liga]], also criticized the plan and said in a statement that it would consider legal action to block the expansion.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 17, 2022 |title=Spanish league attacks FIFA's plan for bigger Club World Cup |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/soccer/spanish-league-attacks-fifas-plan-for-bigger-club-world-cup/2022/12/17/592fe95e-7e26-11ed-bb97-f47d47466b9a_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=December 18, 2022}}</ref> Many clubs and national associations have opposed its scheduling, accusing FIFA of prioritizing money over the health of the players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/fifa-accused-of-prioritising-own-interests-after-revealing-club-world-cup-plans-38740610|title=FIFA accused of prioritising own interests after revealing Club World Cup plans|publisher=One Football.com|language=EN|date=December 17, 2023|access-date=December 19, 2023}}</ref>

The addition of the annual [[FIFA Intercontinental Cup]] tournament was also criticized for creating an overload of competitions that would further put the health of the players at risk.<ref name="Guardian-May2024">{{cite news |last=MacInnes |first=Paul |date=May 9, 2024 |title=Fifa must postpone Club World Cup or face legal action, warns players' union |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/09/fifa-must-postpone-club-world-cup-or-face-legal-action-warns-players-union |work=The Guardian |accessdate=May 11, 2024}}</ref> In May 2024, FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum published a letter they sent to FIFA that calls on a rescheduling of the tournament as well as a reform to the [[FIFA International Match Calendar]] to give players more time to rest between major competitions, which have also seen expansions. The organizations also stated in the letter that they would advise member clubs to seek legal action or other options in the event that schedule congestion is not addressed.<ref name="Guardian-May2024"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=May 9, 2024 |title=Club World Cup: Why FIFA is facing pushback over US-staged tournament |url=https://apnews.com/article/fifa-club-world-cup-1a8a852dd1c3892737a757fd40fd7f8b |access-date=August 19, 2024 |website=AP News |language=en |archive-date=August 19, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819162230/https://apnews.com/article/fifa-club-world-cup-1a8a852dd1c3892737a757fd40fd7f8b |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 13, 2024, FIFPRO announced that England's [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) and France's  [[Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels]] (UNPF) submitted a legal claim with the [[Commercial Tribunal (Belgium)|Business Court]] in [[Brussels]] to protest the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |agency=[[PA Media]] |title=Footballers' union starts legal action against Fifa over Club World Cup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/footballers-union-fifpro-legal-action-fifa-club-world-cup |website=The Guardian |access-date=June 14, 2024 |date=June 13, 2024}}</ref> FIFPRO has warned throughout 2024 that if a compromise is not reached about the Club World Cup, their players may organize a strike.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://apnews.com/article/club-world-cup-player-strike-17f5f3644dfddbec0132445a54bc72eb | title=Club World Cup pushback sees the possibility of player strike action raised again | date=November 21, 2024 | work=Associated Press }}</ref> On January 30, 2025, Infantino and FIFPRO met to discuss fixture congestion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fifpro meet with Fifa over fixture congestion concerns |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20kgrz4k30o |website=BBC Sport |access-date=February 9, 2025 |date=January 30, 2025 |archive-date=February 4, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250204003459/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20kgrz4k30o |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a written response to criticism of the added fixtures stated in the letter sent by the FIFPRO and World League Forms, FIFA stated that the accusations stated in the letter were "not supported by facts" and that the schedule for the Club World Cup was aligned with the [[FIFA International Match Calendar]] to assure enough time between the tournament final and the start of domestic leagues to ensure player welfare.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Crafton |first=Adam |date=June 7, 2024 |title=One year until the Club World Cup in the United States - what's going on? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5544103/2024/06/07/club-world-cup-united-states-soccer/ |access-date=August 19, 2024 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=August 17, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817134236/https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5544103/2024/06/07/club-world-cup-united-states-soccer/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Impact of transfers and free agency===
The potential impact of transfers on the tournament was questioned, as the [[Transfer window|summer transfer window]] will be open in many leagues during the tournament, and thus players in the tournament could potentially be moved to a different club during the tournament, including to other teams playing. In addition, many player contracts in Europe expire on June 30, which could affect the participation of some players.<ref name=":1"/>

On October 3, 2024, FIFA announced that an optional transfer window from June 1–10 will be allowed for the member associations whose clubs have qualified for the tournament. Should this window be implemented, it would be available for all clubs from the concerned associations and not only to those participating in the Club World Cup. To address the contract issue, FIFA stated that there would be a "restricted in-competition period" from June 27 to July 3 "within a set limit and according to specific limitations" when the clubs may replace players whose contracts are slated to expire.<ref>{{cite web |title=FIFA Council takes key decisions on FIFA Member Associations and upcoming FIFA competitions |url=https://inside.fifa.com/about-fifa/organisation/fifa-council/media-releases/fifa-council-takes-key-decisions-member-associations-upcoming-competitions |website=Inside FIFA |publisher=FIFA |access-date=October 4, 2024 |date=October 3, 2024 |archive-date=October 3, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241003231247/https://inside.fifa.com/about-fifa/organisation/fifa-council/media-releases/fifa-council-takes-key-decisions-member-associations-upcoming-competitions |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Impact of multi-club ownership===
In an issue not unique to the Club World Cup, some teams in the tournament are owned by multi-club ownership groups, including tournament qualifiers [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] and [[Club León|León]], which are both owned by Grupo Pachuca, and which may raise [[conflict of interest]] concerns.<ref name=":1" /> In response to this concern, FIFA has stated in the tournament regulations that clubs in the competition cannot own shares, be members of other clubs, or influence their performance. Similarly, individuals cannot simultaneously manage or influence multiple clubs. "Influence" in this context is defined as holding a majority of voting rights, having the right to appoint or remove majority board members, controlling a majority of voting rights through agreements, or exercising a decisive influence in the club's decision-making. Should two or more clubs fail to meet the criteria, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee shall review the cases to determine admission status, and the FIFA general secretariat shall allow only one of any conflicted clubs to participate while also selecting the replacement for the prohibited club in the competition.<ref name="regulations" />

In November 2024, Costa Rican club [[Liga Deportiva Alajuelense|Alajuelense]] announced it had requested FIFA to enforce its multi-club ownership rule to disqualify either Pachuca or León and would pursue legal action if necessary.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 20, 2024 |title=Costa Rica's Alajuelense threatens legal action over Club World Cup spot |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/42509544/alajuelense-threatens-legal-action-club-world-cup-spot |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 20, 2024 |archive-date=November 20, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241120213944/https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/42509544/alajuelense-threatens-legal-action-club-world-cup-spot |url-status=live }}</ref> Alajuelense would have been the first team eligible to qualify via CONCACAF's ranking pathway, given the restriction of two clubs per association. However, this assumes the host slot is counted toward the association restriction; otherwise American club [[Philadelphia Union]] would be the first eligible team via the ranking pathway.<ref name="rankings"/> FIFA subsequently ruled that Alajuelense could not be involved in any proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lawton |first=Matt |date=December 2, 2024 |title=Fifa closes door on Costa Rican side challenging Club World Cup rules |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/fifa-hits-back-at-accusations-of-breaking-own-club-world-cup-rules-2ktwtdpm2 |access-date=March 23, 2025 |website=[[The Times]] |url-access=subscription |archive-date=January 15, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250115213802/https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/fifa-hits-back-at-accusations-of-breaking-own-club-world-cup-rules-2ktwtdpm2 |url-status=live }}</ref> On February 4, 2025, Alajuelense filed an appeal at the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] against FIFA, Pachuca, and León.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/club-world-cup-fifa-court-arbitration-sport-alajuelense-3ng9p6kk3|title=Costa Rican club takes Fifa to court over 'breaking' Club World Cup rules|first=Matt|last=Lawton|date=February 3, 2025|website=The Times|url-access=subscription|access-date=February 4, 2025|archive-date=February 9, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250209210506/https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/club-world-cup-fifa-court-arbitration-sport-alajuelense-3ng9p6kk3|url-status=live}}</ref> Ultimately the case against Grupo Pachuca was successful and León was removed from the tournament on March 21, 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inside.fifa.com/legal/judicial-bodies/media-releases/fifa-appeal-committee-decision-on-cf-pachuca-and-club-leon|title=FIFA Appeal Committee decision on CF Pachuca and Club León|website=FIFA Inside|date=March 21, 2025|access-date=March 21, 2025}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' and confirmed by FIFA, the likely replacement will come in a one-game playoff ahead of the tournament between [[2023 CONCACAF Champions League]] runner-up [[Los Angeles FC]] and the highest-ranked by coefficient Mexican club not already in the tournament, [[Club América]], should Leon's expulsion be confirmed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Club World Cup: LAFC and Club America could meet in play-off to qualify |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czrvgdd4xjro |website=BBC Sport |access-date=17 April 2025 |date=31 March 2025}}</ref> Notably, this excludes both [[Liga Deportiva Alajuelense|Alajuelense]] and [[Philadelphia Union]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Abnos |first=Alexander |date=2025-03-31 |title=Fifa considering LAFC v Club América playoff to replace León at Club World Cup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/31/fifa-considering-lafc-v-club-america-playoff-to-replace-leon-at-club-world-cup |access-date=2025-04-08 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Currently, there is an expedited appeal hearing regarding Leon's expulsion scheduled for the week of May 5, 2025.

===Ticket prices===
Initially, prices for matches at the tournament were set very high compared to tournaments such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Championship|UEFA Euros]] with some tickets costing as much as $2,200 for the final due to dynamic pricing. On February 10, 2025, it was reported that FIFA had cut the prices of tickets due to low interest, as the prices for the cheapest tickets for the semi-finals and final had dropped to around $140 and $300, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/fifas-us-bonanza-begins-with-alarming-club-world-cup-ticket-prices-adaptive-pricing-164042681.html|title=FIFA's U.S. bonanza begins with 'alarming' Club World Cup ticket prices, 'adaptive pricing'|date=December 19, 2024|website=Yahoo Sports}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insideworldfootball.com/2025/02/10/fifa-slashes-club-world-cup-ticket-prices-fans-fail-buy-hype|title=FIFA slashes Club World Cup ticket prices as fans fail to buy the hype|date=February 10, 2025|access-date=February 10, 2025|archive-date=February 12, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250212162948/https://www.insideworldfootball.com/2025/02/10/fifa-slashes-club-world-cup-ticket-prices-fans-fail-buy-hype/|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the prices being lowered, FIFA charged a 10% cancellation fee for those who wanted to exchange their tickets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insideworldfootball.com/2025/02/13/bayern-fans-irate-fifa-club-world-club-ticket-pricing-cancellation-fees/|title=Bayern fans irate at FIFA Club World Club ticket pricing and cancellation fees|date=February 13, 2025|access-date=February 13, 2025|archive-date=February 13, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250213163521/https://www.insideworldfootball.com/2025/02/13/bayern-fans-irate-fifa-club-world-club-ticket-pricing-cancellation-fees/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Selection of Inter Miami CF===
As with previous editions of the FIFA Club World Cup, the new format allocated a slot reserved for the host nation.<ref name="slots" /> Traditionally, this slot is filled by the defending champion of the host nation. The champion of [[Major League Soccer]] is determined by a [[MLS Cup|postseason playoff]] rather than the regular season record (in the case of the 2024 season, it was the [[LA Galaxy]]).<ref name="miami yahoo">{{cite news|last=Bushnell|first=Henry|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/fifa-gives-lionel-messi-inter-miami-a-spot-in-2025-club-world-cup-002919588.html|title=FIFA gives Lionel Messi, Inter Miami a spot in 2025 Club World Cup|work=Yahoo Sports|date=October 19, 2024|access-date=November 11, 2024|archive-date=November 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241111062221/https://sports.yahoo.com/fifa-gives-lionel-messi-inter-miami-a-spot-in-2025-club-world-cup-002919588.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The exact qualification method had been left undetermined for an extended period of time into the [[2024 Major League Soccer season|2024 regular season]]. At the mid-season [[2024 MLS All-Star Game|MLS All-Star Game]], league commissioner [[Don Garber]] suggested that the spot could be filled with the 2024 [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] winner, the [[MLS Cup 2024]] winner, or a possible playoff between them.<ref name="MLS CWC">{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/mls-commissioner-don-garber-2024-mls-all-star-game-media-availability-quote-sheet|title=MLS Commissioner Don Garber: 2024 MLS All-Star Game Media Availability Quote Sheet|website=MLSsoccer.com|date=July 25, 2024|access-date=November 11, 2024|archive-date=November 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241111200157/https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/mls-commissioner-don-garber-2024-mls-all-star-game-media-availability-quote-sheet|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="tata athletic">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5733735/2024/08/30/martino-mls-supporters-shield-fifa-world-cup/|title=Gerardo Martino targets MLS Supporters' Shield as route into FIFA Club World Cup|last=Cardenas|first=Felipe|work=The Athletic|url-access=subscription|date=August 30, 2024|access-date=November 11, 2024|archive-date=November 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241111200520/https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5733735/2024/08/30/martino-mls-supporters-shield-fifa-world-cup/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 19, 2024, FIFA announced that the final slot would be given to [[Inter Miami CF]] as winners of the 2024 Supporters' Shield, prior to the beginning of the [[2024 MLS Cup playoffs]] and after Inter Miami CF had already won the Shield.<ref name="miami qual" /> The rationale for this was considered to be because the Club World Cup has traditionally taken the host champions through who won silverware in the "league setting."<ref name="CBS Sports Tom Bogert">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWYtADvDy8|title=Tom Bogert talks playoffs, Messi vs. Cucho, FIFA’s non-transparent process, Season Best XI|website=Youtube.com|date=October 22, 2024|access-date=April 17, 2025|url-status=live}}</ref> FIFA explained that it chose the Supporters' Shield winner because that award reflects a league setting, as opposed to MLS Cup. It also stated that it made the decision prior to Inter Miami's win, but could not announce it until regulations were approved in pre-scheduled conventions.<ref name="CBS Sports Tom Bogert"/>

This decision came under criticism from fans and media pundits for its lack of transparency, lack of qualification by traditional sporting merit, and as an attempt to court sponsors by ensuring that [[Lionel Messi]] would feature in the tournament.<ref name="miami yahoo"/><ref name="miami athletic">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5856541/2024/10/20/lionel-messi-miami-club-world-cup/|title=Lionel Messi at the Club World Cup makes sense – but how he got there is ridiculous|last=Spiers|first=Tim|work=The Athletic|url-access=subscription|date=October 20, 2024|access-date=November 11, 2024|archive-date=November 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241111195227/https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5856541/2024/10/20/lionel-messi-miami-club-world-cup/|url-status=live}}</ref> On November 10, 2024, Inter Miami CF was eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs by [[Atlanta United FC]] in the [[2024 MLS Cup playoffs#Round one|first round]].<ref name="miami reuters">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/club-world-cup-slot-softens-blow-miami-defeat-2024-11-11/|title=Club World Cup slot softens the blow of Miami defeat|last=Phillips|first=Mitch|work=Reuters|date=November 11, 2024|access-date=November 11, 2024}}</ref> Despite this, then-Inter Miami CF head coach [[Gerardo Martino]] defended the selection of the team, arguing that the Supporters' Shield was enough justification for selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/41608519/inter-miami-deserves-club-world-cup-invite-martino|title=Inter Miami deserves Club World Cup invite – Martino|last=Becherano|first=Lizzy|website=espn.com|date=October 4, 2024|access-date=November 13, 2024|archive-date=November 16, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241116151329/https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/41608519/inter-miami-deserves-club-world-cup-invite-martino|url-status=live}}</ref>
