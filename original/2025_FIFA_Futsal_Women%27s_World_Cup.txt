The emblem is a combination of visual elements depicting futsal and references to street art and motifs in the Philippines. Some of the Filipino culture references featured in the logo include the [[vinta]], the [[gabbang]] instrument and traditional [[Binakael]] patterns.<ref name=dynamic-brand/>

The powerful visual identity accompanying the logo, alongside the official slogan of the tournament, "Master The Speed", reflects a game that is constantly on the move and the sights and sounds of the host nation, which are combined with depictions of the futsal ball, the shape of the pitch, and the five members of each team.
