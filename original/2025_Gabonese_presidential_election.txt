== Background ==
{{Main|2023 Gabonese coup d'état}}
In August 2023, a [[2023 Gabonese general election|general election]] was held where incumbent president [[Ali Bongo]] won a third term with 64% of the votes. The results were heavily controversial and disputed and four days later, the [[Armed Forces of Gabon|Gabonese Army]] and the [[Gabonese Republican Guard]], led by Brigadier General [[Brice Oligui Nguema]], who was a cousin of Bongo, led a [[2023 Gabonese coup d'état|coup d'état]] which ousted and arrested Bongo and his government, annulled the election results, and dissolved all state institutions. The military assumed control of the country and established a junta with Nguema as transitional president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/a-coup-in-gabon-who-what-and-why|title=A 'coup' in Gabon: Who, what and why?|work=Aljazeera|date=30 August 2023|access-date=3 March 2025|archive-date=30 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830130359/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/a-coup-in-gabon-who-what-and-why|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gabon-coup-attempt-military-officers-say-election-cancelled-west-africa/|title=Gabon coup attempt sees military chiefs declare election results "cancelled" and "end to current regime"|work=CBS News|first=Frank|last=Andrews|date=30 August 2023|access-date=3 March 2025|archive-date=31 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230831010710/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gabon-coup-attempt-military-officers-say-election-cancelled-west-africa/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/4/gabon-coup-leader-nguema-sworn-in-as-transitional-head-of-state|title=Gabon coup leader Nguema sworn in as transitional head of state|work=Aljazeera|date=4 September 2023}}</ref>

On 9 January 2025, Oligui announced that the country would hold a [[Elections in Gabon|presidential election]] on 22 March 2025. This decision followed the adoption of a new constitution in November 2024, which establishes a presidential system with term limits and stricter eligibility requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gabon : l'élection présidentielle avancée au 22 mars ? |url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1646933/politique/gabon-lelection-presidentielle-avancee-au-22-mars/ |access-date=15 January 2025 |website=JeuneAfrique.com |language=fr-FR |archive-date=14 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250114172309/https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1646933/politique/gabon-lelection-presidentielle-avancee-au-22-mars/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, on 22 January, the government announced that the election would be held on 12 April 2025.<ref name="auto"/> The date was six months earlier than the transition arrangement allowed for.<ref name=":0" />

On 20 January, the [[Parliament of Gabon|Transitional Parliament]] approved a new electoral code, allowing members of the security forces and magistrates to run for office and reserving two seats in parliament for members of the Gabonese diaspora. It also allowed dual nationals to become candidates except in presidential elections, without having to renounce their other nationality and moved the responsibility of organising elections from local governments to the interior ministry.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 January 2025 |title=Gabon approves new electoral law seen as win for junta leader |url=https://www.africanews.com/2025/01/21/gabon-approves-new-electoral-law-seen-as-win-for-junta-leader/ |access-date=21 January 2025 |website=Africanews |language=en |archive-date=21 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250121154505/https://www.africanews.com/2025/01/21/gabon-approves-new-electoral-law-seen-as-win-for-junta-leader/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
