However, after American president-elect [[Proposed United States acquisition of Greenland|Donald Trump renewed his interest in Greenland]], Egede played down any notion of immediate independence and instead stressed the need for reforms of the cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland at a press conference in Copenhagen on 10 January 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/groenlaenderne-vil-ikke-vaere-danskere-eller-amerikanere-her-er-de-vigtigste-pointer|title=Grønlænderne vil ikke være danskere - eller amerikanere: Her er de vigtigste pointer fra pressemøde|website=DR|date=10 January 2025}}</ref> In an interview on [[Fox News]] on 16 January, Egede stated that Greenlanders have no wish to become a part of the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/greenlands-prime-minister-says-arctic-island-doesnt-want-part-us-always-strong-partner|title=Greenland's prime minister says Arctic island doesn't want to be part of the US: 'Always be a strong partner'|website=Fox News|date=16 January 2025}}</ref> and an opinion poll that month showed 85% of those surveyed opposed the proposal with 6% in favour and 9% unsure.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-29 |title=Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose becoming part of the United States, poll shows |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/poll-shows-85-greenlanders-do-not-want-be-part-us-2025-01-29/ |website=Reuters}}</ref> In the leadup to the election, the opposition leader [[Jens Frederik Nielsen]] ([[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrats]]) spoke in support for complete independence, telling [[Sky News]] that Greenland is "not for sale."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waghorn |first1=Dominic |title=President Trump is forcing Greenlanders to confront their future |url=https://news.sky.com/story/president-trump-is-forcing-greenlanders-to-confront-their-future-13326109 |access-date=12 March 2025 |work=Sky News |date=11 March 2025}}</ref> In a final televised debate before the day before the election, the leaders of all five parties represented in the Inatsisartut voiced their distrust of Trump; only Karl Ingemann, leader of Qulleq, voiced trust in Trump.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/greenland-election.html|date=March 12, 2023|newspaper=New York Times|title=In Trump's Shadow, Greenland Votes for a New Government|first1=Christian Ulloriaq|last1=Jeppesen|first2=Maya|last2=Tekeli|first3=Jeffrey|last3=Gettleman}}</ref>

Separate to the issue of independence, the economy was also an important theme, with debate over how is best to support commerce and industry, and ultimately strengthen the Greenlandic economy. Other issues included Greenland's relationship with international climate agreements, the functioning of the health care system, and social problems related to high house prices and homelessness.<ref>[https://www.information.dk/indland/2025/02/groenlandsk-chefredaktoer-nuancerne-forsvinder-naar-kun-yderpolerne-kommer-orde?

The 31 members of the [[Inatsisartut]] are elected by [[open list]] [[proportional representation]] in a single nationwide constituency.

Numerous areas where Siumut has traditionally been the strongest force, especially the villages, fell to Naleraq, a party which is popular with fishermen and hunters and takes the strongest pro-independence stance, while Demokraatit won numerous votes in the cities previously dominated by Inuit Ataqatigiit. The election result was interpreted as indicating that solving Greenland's internal social and economic problems took priority over achieving independence as quickly as possible. It was suspected that the extensive [[nationalization]] and [[monopolization]], as well as the associated fisheries policy, had caused resentment among the population, who wanted a more liberal approach, while others were demonstrating their dissatisfaction with [[Denmark]] by voting for Naleraq.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mogensen |first=Lars Trier |date=2025-03-12 |title=Blåt protestvalg i Grønland |url=https://www.information.dk/indland/2025/03/blaat-protestvalg-groenland |access-date=2025-03-12 |website=Information |language=da}}</ref> Kuno Fencker, a Naleraq MP, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "Before, people voted mostly Siumut – it was like a football club that they never left.

==Reactions==
Danish Defense Minister [[Troels Lund Poulsen]] congratulated the Democrats and said that the future of Greenland is up to Greenlanders, not the United States, while Prime Minister [[Mette Frederiksen]] also congratulated the Democrats calling the results "a celebration of democracy."<ref name="AP"/> On 20 March, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service and the [[Danish Police Intelligence Service]] said that it had not found evidence of a systematic and coordinated campaign by a foreign government or foreign intelligence service to influence the election, while acknowledging that there was rampant misinformation on social media, including the creation of fake profiles pretending to be Danish or Greenlandic politicians and dissemination of false or manipulated information.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-03-20 |title=No evidence of foreign state influence on Greenland’s election, Denmark says |url=https://apnews.com/article/greenland-election-denmark-influence-misinformation-e1ac21dac2121b9caee0131e22a81415 |access-date=2025-03-20 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref>
