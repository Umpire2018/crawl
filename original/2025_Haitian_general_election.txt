==Background==
{{Main|2021 Haitian protests}}
In 2021, mass street demonstrations and violent protest marches began across Haiti on 14 January in protest at [[Jovenel Moïse]]'s plan to run for one more year in power. Since then, hundreds of thousands took part in weekly protests calling for the government to resign. [[Assassination of Jovenel Moïse|Moïse was assassinated]] on 7 July 2021.

On 8 July, interim prime minister [[Claude Joseph]]'s office announced that despite the assassination, the parliamentary elections would still be held on the date set by the Provisional Electoral Council and that members of the opposition would be included in election timetable talks, stating that "The Head of Government promises to hold talks with opposition leaders and other actors in national life to calm the socio-political climate and facilitate inclusive and credible elections according to the timetable set by the Provisional Electoral Council."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://haitiantimes.com/2021/07/08/interim-pm-haiti-will-move-forward-with-fall-elections/|title=Interim PM: Haiti will move forward with fall elections|first=Sam|last=Bojarski|website=Haiti Times|date=8 July 2021|accessdate=8 July 2021}}</ref> The United Nations special envoy for Haiti, [[Helen La Lime]], said that interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph would lead Haiti until elections were held later in the year, urging all parties to set aside differences following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Haiti's prime minister to lead country until election following president's assassination: UN|url=https://globalnews.ca/video/8013670/haitis-prime-minister-to-lead-country-until-election-following-presidents-assassination-un/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Global News|language=en-US}}</ref> Ariel Henry was appointed as acting prime minister later that month.

Henry dismissed all members of the [[Provisional Electoral Council]], seen by many in the country as politically biased, on 27 September 2021. He stated that a new council would be appointed which would hold the elections in early 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haitis-elections-postponed-after-electoral-council-dismissed-2021-09-28/|title=Haiti's elections postponed after electoral council dismissed|first1=Gessika|last1=Thomas|first2=Sarah|last2=Marsh|editor-first=Rosalba|editor-last=O'Brien|work=Reuters|url-access=registration|date=28 September 2021|access-date=14 September 2022}}</ref> On 11 September 2022, he stated that the government would begin the organization of elections by the end of 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/news/caribbean-news/prime-minister-henry-gives-commitment-that-haiti-will-be-in-election-mode-before-year-end/|title=Prime Minister Henry gives commitment that Haiti will be in election mode before year end|work=Caribbean National Weekly|date=13 September 2022|access-date=14 September 2022}}</ref>

On 21 December 2022, Henry signed an agreement with political parties, civil society organizations and private sector members to hold the elections in 2023, with the new government scheduled to be sworn in on 7 February 2024.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-38427-haiti-flash-the-pm-signed-a-historic-consensus-for-an-inclusive-transition.html|title=The PM signed a "historic" consensus for an inclusive transition|work=Haiti Libre|date=22 December 2022|access-date=3 January 2023}}</ref>

In February 2024, however, Henry stated that the elections will be held when the government was able to control the security situation in Haiti.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/americas/haiti-elections-security-intl/index.html|title=Haiti elections will take place when security improves, PM Henry says as protests grow|author1=Sahar Akbarzai|author2=Jeremy Dupin|work=CNN|date=8 February 2024|access-date=13 March 2024}}</ref> The [[Caribbean Community]] later in the month said that he had committed to holding the elections by 31 August 2025.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haiti-pm-commits-elections-by-2025-caricom-send-team-2024-02-29/|title=Haiti PM commits to elections by 2025, CARICOM to send team|author=Sarah Morland|work=Reuters|date=29 February 2024|access-date=13 March 2024}}</ref>

On 11 March 2024, Henry agreed to resign as the leader of Haiti due to facing pressure following [[2024 Haitian jailbreak|attacks]] by armed gangs who demanded he step down, once a [[Transitional Presidential Council|transitional presidential council]] was formed, following a meeting in [[Jamaica]] with leaders of Caribbean states and U.S. Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken]].<ref name="resigned">{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/haiti-henry-resignation-prime-minister-violence-28acaecc1d80d993c99fe43a5e1e1f7f|title=Haiti's prime minister says he'll resign as violent gangs rampage.

==Electoral system==
The [[president of Haiti]] is elected using the [[two-round system]], with a second round held if no candidate wins a majority of the vote in the first round.

The 119 members of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]] are elected in single-member constituencies for four-year terms using a modified [[two-round system]]; a candidate must receive either over 50% of the vote, or have a lead over the second-placed candidate equivalent to 25% of the valid votes in order to be elected in the first round; if no candidate meets this requirement, a second round is held, in which the candidate with the most votes wins.<ref>[http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2137_B.htm Chambre des Députés (Chamber of Deputies): Electoral system] IPU</ref>

One third of the 30-member Senate is elected every two years. The members are elected from ten single-member constituencies based on the [[Departments of Haiti|departments]], also using the two-round system.<ref>[http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2138_B.htm Sénat (Senate): Electoral system] IPU</ref>
