On 21 January 2025, a fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel at the [[Kartalkaya|Kartalkaya ski resort]] in [[Bolu Province]], <!-- MOS:GEOLINK [[-->Turkey<!--]]-->, killed at least 78 people, and injured 51 others. The fire started in the hotel's fourth floor kitchen/restaurant section. It occurred during the Turkish winter school break, when the hotel was 80–90% full. The scale of the fire and number of deaths were exacerbated by the absence of [[smoke detector]]s,  [[automatic sprinkler]]s, functioning [[fire alarm]]s, functioning [[Emergency light|emergency exit lights]], and other fire safety measures. Rescue efforts were hampered by freezing weather and the hotel's remote location; firefighters did not arrive until over an hour after the fire was reported. Most victims died from suffocation.

== Background ==
The Grand Kartal Hotel was built in 1998 by Mazhar Murtezaoğlu, the founder of the [[Kartalkaya|Kartalkaya Ski Resort]].<ref name="wood"/> Inspired by the ski resorts in [[Switzerland]], Murtezaoğlu built two hotels in the region, the Kartal Hotel (built in 1978) and the Grand Kartal Hotel. After Murtezaoğlu's death in 2019, his son-in-law Halit Ergül took over the management of the Grand Kartal Hotel.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-21 |title=Kartalkaya Grand Kartal Otel'in sahibi Halit Ergül kimdir?

== Cause ==
=== Inspection and certification ===
Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government exchanged accusations of blame with the local Bolu municipality, which is controlled by Turkey's main opposition party, the [[Republican People's Party]].<ref>Susan Fraser (24 January 2025).

The Turkish [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Tourism]] assigns inspectors who inspect tourism investments and enterprises. This includes inspecting safety measures.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Turizm Yatırım, İşletme ve Kuruluşlarının Denetimi Hakkında Yönetmelik |trans-title=Regulation on the audit of tourism investments, businesses, and organizations |url=https://teftis.ktb.gov.tr/yazdir?577245325979682CB3CC6F43B049BB22 |access-date=2025-01-22 |website=teftis.ktb.gov.tr}}</ref> A 3 April 2012 regulation published in the ''[[Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey]]'' reduced the [[fire safety]] inspection rights of municipal [[fire brigade]]s, transferring all matters requiring interpretation or clarification to the [[Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change|Turkish Ministry of Environment]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Özgur |first=Bahadır |date=2025-01-21 |title=Müteahhitler istedi, itfaiyenin denetim yetkisi alındı! |trans-title=Contractors requested, fire department inspection authority was obtained! |url=https://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/muteahhitler-istedi-itfaiyenin-denetim-yetkisi-alindi-makale-1751366 |access-date=2025-01-22 |website=[[Gazete Duvar]] |language=tr-TR}}</ref>

After the fire, [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Turkish Minister of Tourism]] [[Mehmet Ersoy]] nonetheless claimed that fire brigades were responsible for issuing fire competence certificates, and that local fire brigades are the only authorities authorized to inspect fire safety measures. He later changed his explanation, saying that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism lacked authority to license or oversee the building, and that "If it is within the municipality's jurisdiction, the responsibility falls to the municipality.
