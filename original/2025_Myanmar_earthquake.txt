{{Further|Sagaing Fault|Geology of Myanmar}}
[[File:Sagaing Fault mapv2.pdf|400px|thumb|The Sagaing Fault can be divided into segments]]

Myanmar is wedged between four [[tectonic plates]] (the [[Indian plate|Indian]], [[Eurasian plate|Eurasian]], [[Sunda plate|Sunda]], and [[Burma plate]]s) that interact in active [[Plate tectonics|geological processes]]. Along the west coast of the [[Coco Islands]], off the Rakhine coast, and into Bangladesh, is a highly oblique [[convergent boundary]] known as the [[Sunda megathrust]]. This large fault marks the boundary between the Indian and Burma plates. The megathrust emerges from the seafloor in Bangladesh, where it runs parallel and east of the [[Chin Hills]]. This boundary continues to the north of Myanmar where it ends at the eastern [[Himalayas]].<ref name="Wangthesis" />

A {{Convert|1400|km|adj=on}} [[transform fault]] runs through Myanmar and connects the Andaman [[Divergent boundary|spreading center]] to a [[Main Frontal Thrust|collision zone]] in the north. Called the [[Sagaing Fault]], it is a boundary between the [[Burma plate|Burma]] and [[Sunda plate]]s as they slide past each other at {{cvt|18–49|mm}} per year. It is Myanmar's largest and most active source of earthquakes, running through or close to major cities including [[Yangon]], [[Naypyidaw]], and [[Mandalay]]. Large and damaging earthquakes occurred along the fault in [[1930 Bago earthquake|May]] and [[1930 Pyu earthquake|December]] 1930 ({{M|s}} 7.3 & 7.5) [[1931 Myitkyina earthquake|1931]] ({{M|s}} 7.5), [[1946 Sagaing earthquakes|1946]] ({{M|w}} 7.3 & 7.7), [[1956 Sagaing earthquake|1956]] ({{M|s}} 7.0), 1991 ({{M|w}} 6.9) and [[2012 Shwebo earthquake|2012]] ({{M|w}} 6.9).{{sfn|Wang|2013|pp=27–29}} The magnitudes of earthquakes on the Sagaing Fault vary across the fault zone from {{M|w}} 7.0 to 8.0. The [[recurrence interval]] also varies depending on the location along the fault; its southern segments, which ruptured in 1930, have return periods of 100–150 years based on [[paleoseismological]] studies.<ref name="Wangthesis" />

Destructive earthquakes have affected the area for centuries, but academic research has been limited. Most earthquakes in Myanmar, including large surface rupturing events, are thus not well understood. A large {{M|w}} 8.5–8.8 [[1762 Arakan earthquake|earthquake in 1762]] ruptured a section of the [[Sunda megathrust]] off the Rakhine coast. That earthquake may have been caused by the Indian plate [[subducting]] beneath the Burma plate along the [[Megathrust earthquake|megathrust]]. Remnants of the subducted Indian plate beneath central Myanmar also cause [[intraslab earthquake]]s; one example is the [[1975 Bagan earthquake]] ({{M|w}} 7.0) which occurred at a depth of {{cvt|120|km}}.<ref name="Wangthesis">{{cite thesis|last=Wang|first=Y.|year=2013|title=Earthquake Geology of Myanmar|type=Ph.D.|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|docket=|doi=10.7907/XWW2-9P26|url=https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7853/}}</ref>

According to a study published in ''Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth'', the Sagaing Fault can be divided into two regions; the northern and southern sections. The Sagaing Fault between 16.5 and 23.5 degrees north latitude is defined as the southern section. It is further divided into five segments from south to north; the Bago, Pyu, Naypyidaw, Meiktila, and Sagaing segments. The Naypyidaw segment is characterised by two parallel faults running for {{cvt|70|km}} with parts of them located beneath the capital city, Naypyidaw. The last recorded earthquake was in 1929 with a magnitude smaller than 7.0. The {{cvt|220|km}} long Meiktila segment extends between Mandalay and Naypyidaw and is characterised as a linear feature. The nearly flat topography across this segment suggest the slip component is entirely horizontal. This segment has not experienced any major earthquakes, although it possibly ruptured during the [[1839 Ava earthquake]]. The Sagaing segment is also another linear segment that runs parallel to the [[Irrawaddy River]]. The northern part of this segment ruptured during one of the [[mainshock]]s in the [[1946 Sagaing earthquakes]], while the [[1956 Sagaing earthquake]] ruptured the southern strand.<ref name="Wang2014">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Yu|last2=Sieh|first2=Kerry|last3=Tun|first3=Soe Thura|last4=Lai|first4=Kuang-Yin|last5=Myint|first5=Than|title=Active tectonics and earthquake potential of the Myanmar region|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|year=2014|volume=119|issue=4|pages=3767–3822|doi=10.1002/2013JB010762|bibcode=2014JGRB..119.3767W|hdl=10220/19774|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

This earthquake also affected Thailand, with damage primarily concentrated in the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Bangkok region]], about {{cvt|1,000|km}} away from the epicenter. Bangkok's geology, characterised by a top layer of soft marine clay, renders its emerging high-rises vulnerable to distant, powerful earthquakes, as the ubiquitous clay layer contributes to local [[Seismic site effects|site effects]] amplifying [[long-period ground motion]] which in turn can match the [[resonant frequency]] of tall buildings.<ref name="12th World Conference" /><ref name="The Nation 2014" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ornthammarath|first1=Teraphan|last2=Jirasakjamroonsri|first2=Amorntep|last3=Pornsopin|first3=Patinya|last4=Rupakhety|first4=Rajesh|last5=Poovarodom|first5=Nakhorn|last6=Warnitchai|first6=Pennung|author7=Tun Tun Tha Toe|title=Preliminary analysis of amplified ground motion in Bangkok basin using HVSR curves from recent moderate to large earthquakes|journal=Geoenvironmental Disasters|volume=10|issue=1|year=2023|page=28|issn=2197-8670|doi=10.1186/s40677-023-00259-0|doi-access=free|bibcode=2023GeoDi..10...28O}}</ref> Occupants in Bangkok have often felt effects from earthquakes centered many hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away.

===Rupture process===
According to a finite fault model released by the {{abbr|USGS|United States Geological Survey}}, the [[earthquake rupture]] extended about {{cvt|530|km}} by {{cvt|20|km}} from [[Singu]] in Mandalay to [[Kyauktaga Township|Kyauktaga]] in [[Bago Region|Bago]]. From the epicenter the rupture propagated more than {{cvt|85|km}} to the north and terminated just south of Singu. About {{cvt|445|km}} of the rupture occurred to the south where it terminated at Kyauktaga. Most of the slip which exceeded {{cvt|1|m}} was concentrated between Singu and [[Oktwin]] while less than {{cvt|1|m}} of slip occurred beneath Pyu and further south. A gap with an apparent lack of slip exists between Naypyidaw and Pyu which the USGS attributes to a lack of observations. A maximum slip of {{cvt|4.3334|m|ft}} was recorded southeast of the [[hypocenter]], between Sagaing and [[Amarapura]]. The entire rupture process took just over 80 seconds with the greatest phase of seismic moment release occurring about 30 seconds after initiation. The rupture is thought to have propagated at speeds in excess of the [[S wave|shear wave]] velocity, making this an example of a [[supershear earthquake]].<ref name="mainshock"/>

Satellite data also confirmed the inferred observations of an exceptionally long [[surface rupture]] extending from [[Kyaukmyaung (Sagaing)|Kyaukmyaung]], Sagaing to [[Kyauktaga Township|Penwegon]], Bago. The length of the surface rupture from satellite data was {{cvt|500|km}}. Throughout most of the rupture, slip at the surface exceeded {{cvt|3|m}} while around the epicenter area, reached {{cvt|4–5|m}}.<ref name="Bradley2">{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Kyle|last2=Hubbard|first2=Judith A.|title=Surface ruptures of the Myanmar M7.7 earthquake mapped from space|url=https://earthquakeinsights.substack.com/p/surface-ruptures-of-the-myanmar-m77|doi=10.62481/51b7df8c|access-date=2 April 2025|work=Earthquake Insights|date=2 April 2025}}</ref> A study of satellite data at the [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] revealed that up to {{cvt|6|m}} of horizontal displacement occurred along the fault.<ref>{{cite news|title=Myanmar Quake Caused Ground Shift of Up to 6 Meters: Study|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2025040200797/|access-date=2 April 2025|work=Jiji Press|publisher=Nippon.com|date=2 April 2025}}</ref>

Italy's [[National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology]] published their finite fault model comprising three north–south trending segments. They proposed that each segment produced a magnitude 7.5 and ruptured for a total length of {{cvt|500|km}}. The three segment ruptures corresponded in a cumulative moment magnitude of 7.8. According to their model, the earthquake produced a maximum slip of {{cvt|7.4|m}} at a depth of {{cvt|1.9|km}} along the central segment north of Naypyidaw.<ref name="ingv1">{{cite web|title=Earthquake with magnitude of Mwpd 7.7 on date 28-03-2025 and time 07:20:56 (Italy) in region Myanmar|url=http://terremoti.ingv.it/en/finitesource_summary/42162362|publisher=National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology|access-date=11 April 2025|date=11 April 2025}}</ref>

A 2011 study by Nobuo Hurukawa and Phyo Maung Maung in ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' identified two [[seismic gap]]s along the Sagaing Fault. One of these gaps is located in central Myanmar between 19.2 degrees north and 21.5 degrees north, corresponding to the Meiktila segment.

Seismologists Judith Hubbard and Kyle Bradley said this seismic gap is located between the 1929 (Naypyidaw semgent) and 1956 (southern Sagaing segment) ruptures. The pair said the 2025 earthquake ruptured the entire seismic gap and extended further north and south of it based on their analysis of the finite fault model by the USGS. The rupture extent corresponded with the Pyu, Naypyidaw, Meiktila and the southern part of the Sagaing segments. The southern extent of the rupture overlapped the rupture zones of the 1929 (Naypyidaw segment) and December 1930 (Pyu segment) earthquakes.<ref name="Bradley3">{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Kyle |last2=Hubbard |first2=Judith |title=Further thoughts about the very long fault rupture in Myanmar |url=https://earthquakeinsights.substack.com/p/further-thoughts-about-the-very-long |website=Earthquake Insights |publisher=SubStack |access-date=15 April 2025}}</ref> The fault extent involved in the {{M|w}} 7.1 earthquake in 1956 also seemed to have moved during the 28 March 2025 event.

===Intensity===
[[File:Map alert Nr3 Myanmar M7.7 damage 01.png|thumb|Map showing estimated degree of damage (black to yellow) in settlements marked as dots.]]

A USGS seismic installation at [[Naypyidaw]] recorded 0.6231 ''g'' in ground acceleration (pga) and {{cvt|161.42|cm/s}} in ground velocity; the station data corresponded to a [[Modified Mercalli intensity]] of X (''Extreme'').<ref>{{Cite anss|M 7.7 – 2025 Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar) Earthquake – ShakeMap|2025|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/shakemap/stations?source=us&code=us7000pn9s}}</ref>

The USGS' [[PAGER]] service estimated at least 415,000 people in areas of [[Mandalay Region|Mandalay]], [[Bago Region|Bago]], [[Naypyidaw]] and [[Sagaing Region|Sagaing]] were exposed to MMI X.

==Aftermath==
In a statement by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) on 1 April, shelter, clean water and medicine were running low in Myanmar. Additionally, due to the lack of clean water, the United Nations warned about the possibility of a cholera outbreak. The [[World Health Organization]] said that many hospitals in the region were also running beyond their intended capacity. Damaged roads and bridges also hampered rescue missions. OCHA added that it took their team 13 hours to reach Mandalay from Yangon instead of the typical eight-hour travel time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Water and medicine in short supply after Myanmar earthquake: UN|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/water-and-medicine-in-short-supply-after-myanmar-earthquake-un|access-date=1 April 2025|agency=Reuters|work=The Straits Times|date=1 April 2025}}</ref> In many parts of Myanmar, the first responders were volunteer groups who, without special equipment, tried to pull survivors from the rubble.<ref name="Ratcliffe4">{{cite news|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Rebecca|title='No one came': Myanmar volunteers dig with bare hands to save earthquake victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/29/myanmar-volunteers-dig-earthquake-victims|access-date=3 April 2025|work=The Guardian|date=3 April 2025}}</ref>

Although the military regime appealed for international aid, several human rights organisations said there is selective allocation of assistance. Some affected regions such as Sagaing and Shan were receiving less aid whereas most resources were directed at Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Some groups said the regime may be falsely claiming logistical challenges to rationalise restricting aid in resistance-controlled areas.
