Enrica Picco from the think tank [[International Crisis Group]] said that the attack and the response by security forces shows that "Tensions are very high at the presidential palace." Additionally, she said, "Deby knows that he has a lot of enemies who want to replace him or change the way Chad is dealing with different crises."<ref name=":8" />

Ulf Laessing from the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] however, disagreed it could be Boko Haram related. "The jihadists are mainly active in the [[Lake Chad]] region and do not carry out attacks as complex as the one on the presidential palace," he said. "The attackers knew where to go and they were expected at the same time. I rather suspect that it is an intrigue within the presidential family or the clans in the palace."<ref name=":11" />

Chadian President Mahamat Déby released a statement on his official Facebook page saying he believed he was the main target of the attack and thanked the Presidential Guard for their defense of the presidential compound.<ref name=":4" /> In his message he said: "The attackers of this vain attempt aimed to crush me but they were crushed by the bravery, vigilance and courage of the Presidential Guard."<ref name=":12" /> He said that the identities and motivations of the attackers were not known, and a full investigation should determine their identities.<ref name=":4" />

Infrastructure Minister Aziz Mahamat Saleh posted on his Facebook page, "Nothing serious, no panic; the situation is under control."<ref name=":0" /> Abderaman Koulamallah said in a video posted on Facebook "It was a little incident ... everything is calm. ...
