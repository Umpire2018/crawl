On January 1, 2025, at around 3:15&nbsp;a.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]] ([[UTC−06:00|UTC–6]]), Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old American man, [[Vehicle-ramming attack|drove a pickup truck]] into a crowd on [[Bourbon Street]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, United States, then exited the truck and engaged in a shootout with police before being fatally shot. Fourteen victims were killed, plus the perpetrator, and at least fifty-seven others were injured, including two police officers who were shot.<!--Per [[MOS:NUMNOTES]], comparable values nearby one another should be all spelled out or all in figures--> The attack occurred during [[New Year's Day|New Year celebrations]] in the city, which was scheduled to host the [[2025 Sugar Bowl]] later that day.

The assailant, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was an American-born resident of [[Houston]], Texas. An [[Islamic State]] (ISIS) flag was found in the truck. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) determined that Jabbar had been inspired by ISIS. It investigated the matter as [[domestic terrorism]], since there was no evidence of any foreign direction behind the attack. Jabbar, who had been [[Radicalization|radicalized]], posted videos [[Bay'ah|pledging his allegiance]] to ISIS in the hours before the attack.

Jabbar was divorced three times and had financial problems. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2012, he married again (2013 to 2016), and finally a third time (2017 to 2022). He secured a job at [[Deloitte]] in 2021<ref name="bbc.com"/> as a "senior solutions specialist" in government and public services with a yearly salary of $120,000, a quarter of which was spent in [[alimony]] and child support.
