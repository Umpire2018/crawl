On November 29, 2023, the COMELEC disqualified [[Smartmatic]] from all procurement processes conducted by the agency amid the company's involvement with the alleged bribery schemes concerning COMELEC Chairman [[Andres Bautista]], citing an "imminent threat to the strength and integrity" of the country's electoral process.<ref>{{Cite web |last=de Leon |first=Dwight |date=2023-11-29 |title=Comelec disqualifies Smartmatic from future Philippine elections |url=https://www.rappler.com/philippines/comelec-disqualifies-smartmatic-participation-elections/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240418111137/https://www.rappler.com/philippines/comelec-disqualifies-smartmatic-participation-elections/ |archive-date=April 18, 2024 |access-date=2024-06-19 |website=RAPPLER |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Tulad |first=Victoria |date=2023-11-29 |title=Smartmatic disqualified from Comelec procurements: Garcia |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/29/23/smartmatic-disqualified-from-comelec-procurements |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240619175623/https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/29/23/smartmatic-disqualified-from-comelec-procurements |archive-date=June 19, 2024 |access-date=June 19, 2024 |work=[[ABS-CBN News]]}}</ref>

=== Schedule of barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections ===
{{See also|2023 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections#Postponement}}

On June 27, 2023, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that Republic Act 11935, which postponed [[barangay]] and [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] elections scheduled in December 2022 to October 2023, was unconstitutional, but allowed the [[2023 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections|2023 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections]] (BSKE) elections to push through in its schedule, citing practical and legal implications.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Torres-Tupas |first=Tetch |date=2023-06-27 |title=SC declares law postponing Brgy, SK polls unconstitutional |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794031/supreme-court-declares-law-postponing-barangay-and-sk-elections-unconstitutional-orders-poll-conduct-in-october |access-date=2024-06-29 |website=INQUIRER.net |language=en}}</ref> In view of the decision, the Supreme Court also determined that the next BSKE elections will be held in December 1, 2025, while succeeding elections will be held every three years thereafter on the first Monday of the month.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Sarao |first=Zacarian |date=2023-07-17 |title=Comelec wants 2025 BSKE moved to 2026 |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1803074/comelec-wants-2025-bske-moved-to-2026 |access-date=2024-06-29 |website=INQUIRER.net |language=en}}</ref>

=== Electoral reforms ===
On April 12, 2023, Garcia proposed a "hybrid election system", which entails the use of both automated and manual election systems for the 2025 election.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comelec gets ready for the 2025 hybrid national and local elections |url=https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/13/comelec-gets-ready-for-the-2025-hybrid-national-and-local-elections |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240621035935/https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/13/comelec-gets-ready-for-the-2025-hybrid-national-and-local-elections |archive-date=June 21, 2024 |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=Manila Bulletin |language=en}}</ref>

On its rules for this election, the commission substantially reduced the time period for substitutions due to withdrawals to within the filing of candidacies. Previously, the commission allowed for substitutions after the filing of candidacies was done. The practice of placeholder candidates initially filing candidacies to buy time for the actual candidate was extensively used in recent elections. After the filing of candidacies, substitutions can only be allowed by death or disqualification.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chi |first=Cristina |title=Comelec tightens rules on substitutions |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/05/15/2355325/comelec-tightens-rules-substitutions |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Philstar.com}}</ref>

=== Premature campaigning ===
In May 2024, the [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] (PCIJ) published research indicating at least 14 potential Senatorial candidates collectively spent a total of ₱3.5 million to boost their posts on Facebook. The PCIJ indicated that Senator [[Bong Go]] spent ₱1 million alone on Facebook advertising, being followed by former Senator [[Bam Aquino]] and Secretary [[Benjamin Abalos Jr.]] As such spending is not subject to electoral policy limiting campaign expenditures, Garcia moved to begin the ban on premature campaigning in October 2024, when candidates are due to file their candidacies for public office.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fonbuena |first=Carmela |date=2024-05-23 |title=Bong Go leads ad spending on Facebook a year before 2025 polls |url=https://www.rappler.com/philippines/elections/bong-go-leads-ad-spending-facebook-2024/ |access-date=2024-07-14 |website=RAPPLER |language=en-US |archive-date=September 3, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240903023827/https://www.rappler.com/philippines/elections/bong-go-leads-ad-spending-facebook-2024/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
In the Philippines, congressional and local elections, excluding the regional and barangay levels, have been synchronized to be held on the second Monday of May every three years, starting in 1992. Presidents and vice presidents have six-year terms, so they are only elected in even-numbered years (1992, 1998, and so on). Elections where the presidency is not on the ballot are called [[midterm election]]s, and occur in odd-numbered years (1995, 2001, and so on).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guide to Philippine National Elections |url=https://primer.com.ph/tips-guides/2016/04/02/expats-guide-to-philippine-national-elections/ |access-date=2024-08-01 |website=Tips & Guides |language=en |archive-date=September 3, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240903023826/https://primer.com.ph/tips-guides/2016/04/02/expats-guide-to-philippine-national-elections/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Every seat up for election is voted on separately. Since 2010, general elections have been [[Electronic voting|automated]], with voters shading an oval next to their chosen candidate.<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 11, 2009 |title=Q+A - Why are automated elections in the Philippines a worry? |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-42390920090911 |access-date=November 3, 2021 |work=Reuters |language=en |archive-date=June 15, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230615121441/https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-42390920090911 |url-status=live }}</ref> For executive positions, elections are decided via the [[first-past-the-post voting]] (FPTP) system, where the voter has one choice. Elections to the Senate and local legislatures are held via [[multiple non-transferable vote]], where the voter has ''x'' number of choices depending on the number of seats up for election (12 in the case of the Senate), and the ''x'' candidates with the highest number of votes win. For House elections, each voter has [[Parallel voting|two votes]], one via FPTP, and the other via a modified [[party-list proportional representation]] system.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://academic.oup.com/book/36353 |title=Elections in Asia and the Pacific : A Data Handbook: Volume II: South East Asia, East Asia, and the South Pacific |date=2001-11-15 |publisher=Oxford University PressOxford |isbn=978-0-19-924959-6 |editor-last=Nohlen |editor-first=Dieter |edition=1 |language=en |doi=10.1093/0199249598.001.0001 |editor-last2=Grotz |editor-first2=Florian |editor-last3=Hartmann |editor-first3=Christof |access-date=June 19, 2024 |archive-date=June 11, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240611101354/https://academic.oup.com/book/36353 |url-status=live }}</ref>
