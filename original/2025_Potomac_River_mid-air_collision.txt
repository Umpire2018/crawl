On January 29, 2025, a [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ700]] airliner operating as '''American Airlines Flight 5342''' <!-- Name of flight has been significantly discussed, please see following discussion --> (operated by [[PSA Airlines]] as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]){{Efn|name=Eagle}} and a United States Army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter operating as '''Priority Air Transport 25''' [[Mid-air collision|collided mid-air]] over the [[Potomac River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The collision occurred at 8:47&nbsp;p.m. at an altitude of about {{Convert|300|ft|-2}} and about one-half mile (800 m) short of runway 33 at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia.]] All 67 people aboard both aircraft were killed in the crash, including 64 passengers and crew on the airliner and the 3 crew of the helicopter. It was the first major U.S. commercial passenger flight crash in nearly 16 years since [[Colgan Air Flight 3407]] in 2009, and the deadliest U.S. air disaster since the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 587]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kim |first=Juliana |date=January 31, 2025 |title=41 bodies recovered from D.C. plane crash site as search continues.

See: WP:AVILAYOUT-WW -->

The jet was on [[final approach]] into Reagan National Airport after flying a scheduled route from [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], to D.C, while the helicopter crew was performing a required annual flying evaluation with [[night vision goggles]] and had left from [[Davison Army Airfield]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]. Both aircraft communicated with [[air traffic control]] before they collided. The helicopter crew reported twice that they had visual contact with the airliner and would maintain separation from it, although it is unknown whether they were monitoring the correct aircraft. The crew of the Black Hawk did not hear parts of the tower communication due to a mic press.

On March 11, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) released a preliminary report and urgent safety recommendations, emphasizing the dangerously narrow vertical separation between the runway approach path and the helicopter route. The NTSB chair also expressed anger that the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) did not act on data showing the number of near-miss alerts over the last decade.

==Background==
===Aircraft===
Flight 5342 was operated by a 20-year-old [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ700]], a regional jet commonly used for short- to medium-haul flights. It was configured as a CRJ701ER, denoting a slightly higher seating capacity and extended range. Manufactured in September 2004, it bore the manufacturer's [[serial number]] 10165 and was [[Aircraft registration|registered]] as {{Airreg|N|709PS|.}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hradecky |first=Simon |date=February 14, 2025 |title=Crash: PSA CRJ7 at Washington on Jan 29th 2025, midair collision with helicopter on final |url=https://avherald.com/h?article=52374362 |access-date=February 18, 2025 |work=[[The Aviation Herald]]}}</ref> PSA Airlines is owned by the [[American Airlines Group]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gavin |first=Mike |date=January 29, 2025 |title=What is PSA Airlines?

Reagan National has three runways: 1/19, 15/33, and 4/22. Runways 1/19 handle 95% of commercial aircraft arrivals. Runway 33 handles about 4%, and runway 15—due to its close proximity to the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]—handles less than 1%. Runways 4/22 are too short for commercial aircraft. During north operations, which were in effect at the time of the collision, most arrivals occur on runway 1, with intermittent arrivals on runway 33, depending on traffic demands and separation requirements. The use of runway 33 is typically limited to smaller aircraft, which are able to land on its relatively short {{Convert|5204|ft|m|-long|adj=mid}} surface.<ref name="NTSB Preliminary Report" />

At 8:43&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time|EST]] (01:43&nbsp;[[UTC]]), as American Airlines Flight 5342 was flying a visual approach to runway 1, it made initial contact with the Reagan National control tower. The controller asked if the crew could switch to runway 33. The crew accepted the request and were subsequently cleared to land on runway 33. The helicopter was about {{Convert|1.1|nmi|lk=in|abbr=~}} west of the [[Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)|Key Bridge]] following Helicopter Route 1 to Helicopter Route 4. At 8:46&nbsp;p.m., around two minutes before the collision, the controller called the helicopter crew, advising them of a CRJ700, at an altitude of {{Convert|1200|ft}} south of the [[Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]], circling runway 33. The part of the transmission advising that the CRJ was "circling" was not captured by the helicopter's [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) and may not have been heard by the helicopter crew. The helicopter crew acknowledged that they had the jet in sight and requested [[Visual flight rules|visual separation]]—meaning that they could see and maintain separation from the aircraft on their own—which the controller approved. However, it remains unclear if they had acknowledged the correct aircraft.<ref name="NTSB2025-02-14" /><ref name="Peluffo 2025">{{Cite web |last=Peluffo |first=Guido |date=February 1, 2025 |title=NTSB releases timeline of DC plane crash from recovered black box recorders |url=https://wjla.com/news/local/ntsb-releases-timeline-of-dc-plane-crash-from-recovered-black-box-recorders-potomac-river-recovery-efforts-american-airlines-flight-skaters-victims-black-hawk-army-donald-trump-president-dei-hires-investigation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250203122025/https://wjla.com/news/local/ntsb-releases-timeline-of-dc-plane-crash-from-recovered-black-box-recorders-potomac-river-recovery-efforts-american-airlines-flight-skaters-victims-black-hawk-army-donald-trump-president-dei-hires-investigation |archive-date=February 3, 2025 |access-date=February 5, 2025 |website=WJLA |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jaclyn |date=January 30, 2025 |title=Listen: Air traffic controller audio before the midair plane crash near D.C. |url=https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281166/dca-crash-helicopter-air-traffic-controller-radio |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250203152636/https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281166/dca-crash-helicopter-air-traffic-controller-radio |archive-date=February 3, 2025 |access-date=February 9, 2025 |work=NPR |language=en}}</ref><!-- Discussion on including aircraft behind 5342 -->{{discuss|Inclusion of WaPo 3D analysis}}

At 8:47&nbsp;p.m. EST, 20 seconds before the collision, the controller asked the helicopter crew if they had the CRJ in sight. An audible air traffic radar conflict alert in the background of the transmission was present. One second later, the airliner crew received an automatic [[Traffic collision avoidance system#Types of traffic and resolution advisories|traffic advisory]] from their [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) which was accompanied by an [[Voice warning system|audible announcement]] in the cockpit, "''traffic; traffic''." However, TCAS [[Traffic collision avoidance system#Types of traffic and resolution advisories|resolution advisories]] with audible instructions like "''climb; climb'' " or "''descend; descend''" are automatically disabled when an aircraft is below {{Convert|900|ft}} above ground level to avoid guiding an aircraft into potential collisions with terrain or other aircraft in congested terminal airspace.<ref name="Regan-2025" /><ref name="NTSB Preliminary Report" /> TCAS traffic advisories are disabled below {{Convert|400|ft}}.<ref name="NTSB Preliminary Report" />

Seventeen seconds before the collision, the controller instructed the helicopter to pass behind Flight 5342. One of the helicopter crew members depressed a mic for 0.8 seconds to communicate with the controller during this transmission, which may have caused the "pass behind" part of the transmission to be missed by the helicopter crew. The helicopter crew again confirmed they had an airplane in sight and requested visual separation from the airliner, which the controller approved again. The instructor pilot in the helicopter told the pilot flying that they believed the controller was asking the aircraft to move to the east bank of the Potomac River. Seven seconds before the collision, the airliner "rolled out on final" (finished its turn) to line up with runway 33. One second before the crash, the airliner increased its pitch with its [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] deflected close to its maximum nose-up travel.<ref name="NTSB2025-02-14" />

A single [[air traffic controller]] was managing both aircraft at the time of the crash, an arrangement deemed "not normal" for that time of day at the airport.<ref name="Ember 2025" /> According to the helicopter's cockpit voice and data recorder, the helicopter crew may have missed parts of two transmissions made by the air traffic controller regarding the jet.

=== NTSB preliminary report and recommendations ===
[[File:NTSB Runway 33 - Helicopter 4 Proximity.jpg|thumb|NTSB diagram showing proximity between the two routes]]

The NTSB released a preliminary report on March 11, 2025, accompanied by two urgent safety recommendations to the FAA regarding flight traffic decongestion. Investigators reviewed years of encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near Reagan National Airport, finding that "at least one [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) resolution advisory was triggered per month" since 2011.<ref name="NTSB Preliminary Report" />

Helicopters flying within the route 4 corridor, which is designated for operations "at or below {{Convert|200|ft}}," would have only {{Convert|75|ft}} of vertical separation from a plane landing on runway 33 if flying directly over the eastern shoreline of the Potomac River. Since route 4 lacks lateral boundaries or instructions to operate a defined distance from the shoreline, this already minimal separation decreases further when a helicopter operates farther from the shore.
