==Electoral system==
The [[president of Seychelles]] is elected using the [[two-round system]];<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2883/|title=Republic of Seychelles: Election for President|website=IFES Election Guide}}</ref> if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round is held between the top two candidates.

Members of the [[National Assembly (Seychelles)|National Assembly]] are elected by two methods; 26 (with a new constituency established in 2020) are elected from single-member constituencies using [[first-past-the-post voting]], and up to a further ten are elected based on the percentage of votes received by each party; for each 10% of the total national vote received, a party gets one additional seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2279_B.htm|title=Electoral system|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/seychelles/constitution-politics|title=Seychelles : Constitution and politics|website=The Commonwealth|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201013222727/https://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/seychelles/constitution-politics |archive-date=13 October 2020 }}</ref>
