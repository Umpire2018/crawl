==Electoral system==
Under Article 65(4) of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Singaporean Constitution]], a [[Parliament of Singapore|parliamentary term]] lasts a maximum of five years from its first sitting before its automatic dissolution by law. However, the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], with a [[vote of confidence]] from a majority of sitting [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), can advise the [[President of Singapore|President]] for early dissolution at any time during the five-year term. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Article 65 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore |url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P16-#pr65- |publisher=Attorney-General's Chambers |access-date=22 April 2022 |archive-date=22 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422122132/https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P16-#pr65- |url-status=live }}</ref> A [[General elections in Singapore|general election]] must be held within three months of dissolution.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Singapore Elections Department – Parliamentary Elections|url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/elections_parliamentary.html|access-date=4 March 2018|website=eld.gov.sg|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305142645/http://www.eld.gov.sg/–s_parliamentary.html|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Electoral Divisions (also referred to as seats in Parliament) are organised into [[Single-member district|Single Member Constituencies]] (SMCs) and [[Group Representation Constituencies]] (GRCs). Each SMC returns one MP using the [[first past the post]] voting system, while each GRC returns four or five MPs by [[general ticket|party block voting]]. At least one candidate in the GRC must be from the Malay, Indian or other minority communities. A group of candidates intending to contest an election in a GRC must all be members of the same political party, or a group of independent candidates. The [[voting age]] in Singapore is 21 years. Elections are conducted by the [[Elections Department]] (ELD), a department under the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Singapore Elections Department – About Us|url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/about.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053747/http://www.eld.gov.sg/about.html|archive-date=9 August 2017|access-date=4 March 2018|website=eld.gov.sg|language=en}}</ref>

Under Singapore's constitution, the opposition will be guaranteed a set number of parliamentary seats which may consist of elected members of parliament (MP) from the opposition team and unsuccessful candidates in this election from the best-performing losing opposition party or parties, collectively known as [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament]]. The latest revision of the constitution was set on 27 January 2016, with a 12-seat minimum.

=== Speculations of possible election dates ===

On 8 March 2024, the Elections Department announced that 50,000 public servants had been appointed as election officials.<ref>{{cite web | last=Goh | first=Yan Han | title=50,000 public servants to be appointed as election officials, training to begin in April: ELD | website=The Straits Times | date=8 March 2024 | url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/50000-public-servants-appointed-as-elections-officials-training-to-begin-in-april-eld | access-date=12 March 2025}}</ref> After Lawrence Wong became Singapore's next prime minister in May 2024, the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' speculated that elections could be held as early as September that year. Political observers noted that elections were typically held around the school breaks of March and September. [[Goh Chok Tong]] held his [[1991 Singaporean general election|first general election in August 1991]] ten months after he assumed office in November 1990; his successor [[Lee Hsien Loong]] held his [[2006 Singaporean general election|first general election in May 2006]] two years after he assumed office in August 2004. However, Eugene Tan, an associate professor at [[Singapore Management University]], felt a September election would be "hasty" for Wong to establish his mandate, and that the election was more likely to be held after the announcement of the 2025 budget.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Guild |first1=James |title=Singapore's Budget 2025, Explained |url=https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/singapores-budget-2025-explained/ |access-date=19 March 2025 |work=thediplomat.com |date=5 March 2025}}</ref><ref name="i268" /> Holding the elections in 2025 would coincide with the country's SG60 [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] celebrations.<ref name="i268">{{cite web | last=Iau | first=Jean | title=When is Singapore's next general election?

There has been speculation on when the period of the general election in 2025, with the most likely period being either between March and July or September and October 2025.

Analysts such as Felix Tan reported that the re-handover of the Secretary-General post would not shake the party's voter base and that the CEC were collectively "core individuals that members trust and have confidence in", and that current issues (such as Leong's handover to Poa due to POFMA) would not undermine the party's branding itself.

The SDA, consisting of the [[Singapore Justice Party]] and the [[Singapore Malay National Organisation]], planned to contest in Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC as they did so since 2006. SDA chief [[Desmond Lim]] also stated that the alliance is working to amend its constitution to allow associate members to join under the SDA banner, including independent candidates.<ref name="SS">{{cite web |title=Singapore's smaller opposition parties stake early claim to wards ahead of General Election |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/general-election-opposition-parties-ebrc-voters-constituencies-candidates-4944111 |access-date=24 February 2025 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref> Following the redrawing of electoral boundaries, the SDA announced its plans to contest in Pasir Ris–Changi GRC, and is open to discussions with WP regarding the boundary changes for [[Punggol GRC]]'''.'''<ref name="u3592" /> Despite opposition parties outlining their intentions, Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), viewed it as a strategic move to coordinate among themselves, given that none have the manpower to contest all seats.

=== Reform Party ===
In August 2020, [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] (RP) secretary general [[Kenneth Jeyaretnam]] removed chairman Andy Zhu and treasurer Noraini Yunus from the party's CEC. The party accused Zhu and Yunus of improper handling of the party's bank account, and the CEC unanimously agreed to their removal. Zhu claimed the allegations were "baseless" and criticised Jeyaretnam's "undemocratic stance". He was succeeded by [[Charles Yeo]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 August 2020 |title=Reform Party names Charles Yeo as acting chairman in leadership reshuffle |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/reform-party-names-charles-yeo-acting-chairman-leadership-reshuffle |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220627215438/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/reform-party-names-charles-yeo-acting-chairman-leadership-reshuffle |archive-date=27 June 2022 |access-date=8 January 2021 |work=TODAY}}</ref> In January 2021, Zhu formed a splinter party, [[Singapore United Party]] (SUP), with several former members of RP.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Yuen |first1=Sin |date=5 January 2021 |title=Former Reform Party chairman Andy Zhu and others form new political party, Singapore United Party |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/former-rp-chairman-andy-zhu-and-others-form-new-political-party-singapore-united |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201212311/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/former-rp-chairman-andy-zhu-and-others-form-new-political-party-singapore-united |archive-date=1 February 2021 |access-date=8 January 2021}}</ref> On 15 January 2022, Yeo resigned as chairman following police investigations against him for alleged criminal breach of trust and forgery.

In another analysis on 26 March, Terence Lee, a senior fellow at the [[S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies]], highlighted that the former military officials could provide leadership into politics but they have to also understand the importance of [[soft skills]] if they would chose to contest this election while juggling public life. National University of Singapore associate professor Bilveer Singh cited the transition from military service to politics has been "viable and encouraged", but also noted that political successes are not guaranteed as such.<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2025: Military officers bring leadership to political arena but have to learn ground dynamics, say analysts |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ge2025-military-politics-generals-army-saf-pap-5022866 |access-date=30 March 2025 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref> This analysis came into light following the [[Chief of Army (Singapore)|Chief of Army]] handover on 21 March, with outgoing chief [[David Neo]] did not state on whether he should enter politics,<ref>{{cite web |title=Singapore names new Chief of Army |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-new-chief-army-cai-dexian-david-neo-4958306 |access-date=30 March 2025 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref> and [[Goh Pei Ming]] leaving [[Singapore Armed Forces]] on 1 April.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 April 2025 |title=SAF Chief of Staff Goh Pei Ming steps down ahead of GE2025 |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/saf-chief-of-staff-goh-pei-ming-steps-down-ahead-of-ge2025 |access-date=3 April 2025 |website=The Straits Times |language=en}}</ref>

Similarly, following a series of resignations of six civilists from civil service,<ref>{{cite web |title=Who are the six public service leaders to resign ahead of GE2025 so far? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/who-are-the-six-public-service-leaders-to-resign-ahead-of-ge2025-so-far |access-date=30 March 2025 |website=The Straits Times}}</ref> Terence Ho, adjunct associate professor at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]], cited a likelihood on entering politics due to the exposure into grassroots leadership, and its success is more likely due to experience and familiarity into public service, further adding that these civilists are "independent thinkers". Inderjit Singh however, noted that joining with the opposition parties instead shows a unlikelihood of agreement with policies or feel that the government is not effectively doing their job.<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2025: Why Singapore's high-flying bureaucrats are recruited into politics |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ge2025-civil-servants-public-service-politics-candidates-pap-5015676 |access-date=30 March 2025 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref>

==Campaign==
<!--Please see 2022 Serbian general election as a guide-->

=== Social media ===
Before the election campaign, ''[[The Straits Times]]'' reported in 2024 that politicians and political parties were prioritising their social media presence, with Teo Kay Key predicting that social media would play a significant role in the upcoming general election campaign.<ref name="b990" /> According to Bhavan Jaipragas of ''The Straits Times'', the political climate in Singapore remains "comparatively healthy", but noted increasing polarisation on social media.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jaipragas |first=Bhavan |date=27 March 2025 |title=Keeping fear and loathing out of Singapore's politics |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/keeping-fear-and-loathing-out-of-singapores-politics |access-date=5 April 2025 |website=The Straits Times |language=en}}</ref> 

The PAP has engaged social media influencers, with its MPs having actively used social media for outreach.<ref name="b990" /> According to a March 2025 ''CNA Today'' article, the PAP stated that it avoids a "one-size-fits-all" approach to social media. The party noted that its MPs address a range of issues important to them and their residents, utilising social media in ways that best suit their personalities.<ref name="q834">{{cite web |last1=Yeo |first1=Nikki |last2=Sng |first2=Eunice |date=15 March 2025 |title=Turning 'likes' into votes – how social media and podcasts will shape the GE2025 campaign |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/big-read/general-election-2025-social-media-podcasts-4997721 |access-date=22 March 2025 |website=CNA}}</ref> The WP and other opposition parties have been regularly updating their accounts with walkabout reports and other activities,<ref name="b990" /> and believe social media is essential "for leveling the playing field" and directly engaging with Singaporeans. [[Ravi Philemon]] of RDU said a social media presence is essential to compete against established parties with large followings. However, many had to operate with limited resources and depend on volunteers to manage their social media accounts.<ref name="q834" />

While social media engagement is seen as crucial for voter outreach, Teo believed that the electorate is unlikely to rely solely on social media in their voting choices.<ref name="b990">{{cite web |last=Teo |first=Kay Key |title=Will the social media battle sway voters in S'pore? |website=The Straits Times |date=4 July 2024 |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/will-the-social-media-battle-sway-voters-in-singapore |access-date=14 March 2025}}</ref> The WP views social media as a complement rather than a substitute for its longstanding commitment to on-the-ground engagement. On the other hand, SDP vice-chairman Bryan Lim stated that social media has been effective in addressing "some of the weaknesses of ground work," such as allowing him to connect with constituents he may not have the opportunity to engage with in depth.<ref name="q834" />

}}
Politicians, including prime minister Lawrence Wong, health minister [[Ong Ye Kung]], and NCMP Hazel Poa, have also appeared on local podcasts, which Wong Yang views as part of their communication and campaign strategy.<ref name="d400" /> Producers and hosts of four Singaporean podcasts told ''CNA Today'' that political interest in appearing on their platforms has surged since 2020, especially ahead of this year's election.<ref name="q834" /> Experts interviewed by ''The Straits Times'' suggested that the casual format allows politicians to connect with voters beyond traditional media, particularly younger people and older millennials.<ref name="d400" /> Podcasts also allow guest speakers to share personal anecdotes with in-depth discussions on policy matters.<ref name="q834" /> Kenneth Paul Tan of [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] noted that podcasts in Singapore serve both as hegemonic reinforcement and contestation. While they help the PAP humanise its leaders and foster relatability, it also allows the opposition to bypass mainstream media, challenge the PAP, and appeal to disillusioned Singaporeans especially in Singapore's tightly controlled media landscape.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tan |first=Kenneth Paul |date=17 January 2025 |title=Podcasting Politics in Singapore: Hegemony, Resistance, and Digital Media |journal=Critical Asian Studies |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1080/14672715.2025.2451755 |issn=1467-2715 |doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Dr Natalie Pang, head of NUS communications and new media department, added that such podcasts could provide a platform for individuals with differing political views to engage in candid exchange with one another – an important factor amid rising political polarisation worldwide. Pang also highlighted that some podcast hosts have been willing to challenge politicians on their shows, often voicing public concerns and asking pressing questions.<ref name="d400">{{cite web | last=Wong | first=Yang | title=GE2025: Are video podcasts a new political space to connect with hearts and minds? | website=The Straits Times | date=13 March 2025 | url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ge2025-are-video-podcasts-a-new-political-space-to-connect-with-hearts-and-minds | access-date=14 March 2025}}</ref> Nevertheless, commentators on ''CNA Today'' noted that viral online content does not necessarily translate into electoral success, as voters have mixed opinions on its influence. Moreover, social media’s reach is more confined to specific demographics, particularly younger voters.<ref name="d400" /> 

=== Rally sites ===
In keeping with the approach taken for the general elections in 2011 and 2015, each [[Group Representation Constituency|GRC]] will be designated with two physical rally sites, while each [[Single Member Constituency|SMC]] will be designated with one physical rally site. One site willl also be designated for lunchtime rallies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mha.gov.sg/mediaroom/parliamentary/physical-rally-sites-for-the-upcoming-general-election/Physical |title=Rally Sites for the Upcoming General Election|date=18 February 2025|website=Ministry of Home Affairs}}</ref> Physical rallies made its return after its absence during the 2020 general election due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] safety measures.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-aiming-2-election-rally-sites-each-grc-1-each-smc-4944521|title=Police aiming for 2 election rally sites for each GRC, 1 for each SMC|work=Channel News Asia|date=18 February 2025}}</ref>

===Political broadcasts and debates===
Two rounds of Party Political Broadcasts (PPB) are to be held during the campaigning period on 25 April and 1 May. Political parties fielding at least six candidates under a recognised party symbol are allowed to deliver their campaigning messages on the PPBs.<ref name="Party Broadcast" />

A January 2025 study by Blackbox Research’s sentiment tracker, SensingSG, found that the cost of living remained the primary concern for Singaporeans.<ref name="o016">{{cite web |last=Koh |first=Fabian |date=16 January 2025 |title=Cost of living tops Singaporeans' concerns ahead of GE, 1 in 4 voters undecided on who to support: Survey |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-voter-concerns-general-election-cost-living-inflation-housing-economy-unemployment-4860816 |access-date=25 February 2025 |website=CNA}}</ref><ref name="s042">{{cite web |last=Iau |first=Jean |date=16 January 2025 |title=1 in 4 Singaporeans undecided on who to vote for ahead of election: survey |url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3294981/1-4-singaporeans-undecided-who-vote-ahead-general-election-survey |access-date=12 March 2025 |website=South China Morning Post}}</ref> Eligible voters also cited employment and housing as key issues, while higher-income groups expressed concerns about civil rights and democracy.<ref name="z450">{{cite web |date=17 January 2025 |title=Countdown to GE2025: Sensing Singapore's Mood |url=https://www.blackbox.com.sg/perspectives/sensing-singapores-mood-ahead-of-ge2025 |access-date=25 February 2025 |website=Blackbox Research}}</ref> Respondents in the survey indicated they prioritised the quality of governance at the constituency level rather than the national level, with nearly 90% of respondents expressing this view.

Jaipragas commented that beyond everyday concerns like public housing and living costs, opposition parties should also address geopolitical matters as these can significantly influence domestic issues, particularly with the introduction of [[Tariffs in the second Trump administration|tariffs by the second Trump administration]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Jaipragas |first=Bhavan |date=5 April 2025 |title=GE2025: Singapore voters can't afford to ignore harsh new global realities |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ge2025-singapore-voters-cant-afford-to-ignore-harsh-new-global-realities |access-date=5 April 2025 |website=The Straits Times |language=en}}</ref> The ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' and ''[[Nikkei Asia]]'' expected that economic uncertainties due to the tariffs would be a key concern among voters.<ref name="b766">{{cite web |last=Suruga |first=Tsubasa |date=15 April 2025 |title=Singapore heads into election as tariff worries build: 5 things to know |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Singapore-election/Singapore-heads-into-election-as-tariff-worries-build-5-things-to-know |access-date=15 April 2025 |website=Nikkei Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=15 April 2025 |title='Tough' Singapore election expected for non-Lee leader |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-tough-singapore-election-expected-for-non-lee-leader |access-date=15 April 2025 |website=France 24}}</ref> Jaipragas also called for voters not to take Singapore's relevance and sovereignty for granted as he cited a 2009 Lee Kuan Yew speech.<ref>{{cite web |date=5 December 2023 |title=MM Lee Kuan Yew at the S.
