==Electoral system==
The 51 seats in the [[National Assembly (Suriname)|National Assembly]] are elected using [[party-list proportional representation]]. Previous general elections had been held using ten multi-member constituencies, but following a ruling by the [[Constitutional Court of Suriname|Constitutional Court]] in 2022 that judged that it was unconstitutional, the constituencies were abolished and all 51 seats will be elected from a single nationwide constituency. This case was started by Serena Essed.<ref>[https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/71372 Huidige zetelverdeling districten is van de baan] Star Nieuws, 5 August 2022 {{in lang|nl}}</ref> The Assembly approved the new electoral system on 13 October 2023.<ref>[https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/77956 Kiesstelstel gewijzigd; verkiezingen zijn weer mogelijk] Star Nieuws, 13 October 2023 {{in lang|nl}}</ref>
