The '''2025 The Hague summit''' is an upcoming meeting of the [[heads of state]] and [[heads of government]] of the thirty-two members of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), their partner countries, and the [[European Union]], which will be held in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, on 24–26 June 2025. This will be the first NATO summit to be led by the new [[NATO Secretary General]] and former prime minister of the Netherlands [[Mark Rutte]] since the departure of [[Jens Stoltenberg]] of Norway after a decade as NATO Secretary General.

It was decided at the [[2023 Vilnius summit]] that the Netherlands would be hosting the 2025 edition, marking the first time a NATO summit would take place in the country.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/navo-houdt-oekraine-voorlopig-aan-het-lijntje-zelensky-reageert-gefrustreerd~bb3bcaa7/ |url-access = subscription |date = 11 July 2023 |last = Brouwers |first = Arnout |access-date = 24 May 2024 |language = nl |website = [[de Volkskrant]] |title = Navo houdt Oekraïne voorlopig aan het lijntje, Zelensky reageert gefrustreerd |trans-title = NATO keeps Ukraine in suspense, Zelensky is frustrated }}</ref> The exact date and location, the [[World Forum (The Hague)|World Forum]] in The Hague, were announced by outgoing NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] in May 2024.<ref>{{Cite press release |url = https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm |date = 24 May 2024 |access-date = 24 May 2024 |website = [[NATO]] |title = The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague }}</ref> The last major diplomatic conference held in The Hague was the [[2014 Nuclear Security Summit]], and the city was chosen over [[Rotterdam]], [[Apeldoorn]], and [[Maastricht]].<ref name="nrc">{{Cite news |url = https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2024/05/24/navo-top-in-2025-in-den-haag-alles-wordt-uit-de-kast-gehaald-a4199918 |url-access = subscription |date = 24 May 2024 |last = Derix |first = Steven |access-date = 25 May 2024 |language = nl |website = [[NRC (newspaper)|NRC]] |title = NAVO-top in 2025 in Den Haag: 'Alles wordt uit de kast gehaald' |trans-title = 2025 NATO summit in the Hague: 'Pulling out all the stops' }}</ref>
