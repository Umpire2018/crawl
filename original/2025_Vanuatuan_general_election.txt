Snap general elections were held in [[Vanuatu]] on 16 January 2025,<ref>{{Cite web |last=McKay |first=Ben |date=2024-12-13 |title=Snap election go-ahead as Vanuatu court okays powerplay |url=https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/8846689/snap-election-go-ahead-as-vanuatu-court-okays-powerplay/ |access-date=2024-12-14 |website=Canberra Times |language=en-au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-23 |title=Election date moved to January 16 |publisher=dailypost.vu |url=https://archive.today/20241223153648/https://www.dailypost.vu/news/election-date-moved-to-january-16/article_916083e3-a092-5ad3-bea7-dbfa871f316c.html#selection-2425.39-2425.76 |access-date=2024-12-23 |website=archive.is}}</ref> having been moved from 14 January 2025 due to the [[2024 Port Vila earthquake]] on 17 December.<ref name="candidates"/> The election results showed no political party winning a majority in [[Parliament of Vanuatu|Parliament]], prompting the creation of a coalition government on 27 January.

==Background==
The election was called after President [[Nikenike Vurobaravu]] dissolved [[Parliament of Vanuatu|Parliament]] on the eve of a [[no-confidence motion]] against Prime Minister [[Charlot Salwai]] in November 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-16 |title=Vanuatu holds snap election a month after destructive earthquake |url=https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-election-polling-earthquake-50627ddc370a3a958b80101047d4f7ae |access-date=2025-01-16 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref> Originally scheduled on 14 January 2025, the election was moved to 16 January 2025 due to the [[2024 Port Vila earthquake]] on 17 December.<ref name="candidates"/> There are over 300,000 registered voters.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-16 |title=Voting begins in quake-ravaged Pacific nation of Vanuatu |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/15/world/vanuatu-election-voting-begins-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=2025-01-16 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

==Issues==
The most pivotal issue for many Ni-vans is how to rebuild following the December 2024 earthquake. The estimated cost to rebuild Port Vila, the nation's capital, and other areas affected by the earthquake is 29 billion vatu ($374 million).<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 January 2025 |title=Vanuatu holds snap election as nation braces for costly post-earthquake reconstruction effort |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-16/vanuatu-election-earthquake-recovery-political-instability/104804378 |access-date=16 January 2025 |work=ABC News}}</ref> Additionally, efforts to rebuild following the earthquake only adds to the list of other disasters for which the country needs to rebuild, namely three tropical cyclones in 2023, an airline collapse, and the economic impact of COVID. Fears regarding the safety of an ability to travel may also have effects on the results. In addition to the injuries caused by the earthquake and the loss of personal property, more than 110 classrooms across 45 schools have also been damaged. Moreover the [[Port Vila]] Central Business District remains closed. This could impact whether people feel safe to travel on damaged roads to new polling locations and whether they have the fares required to travel by bus. 

Additionally, political stability could be a motivating issue for some. Within the 18 months prior to the snap election, Vanuatu has experienced three [[Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Ministers]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 January 2025 |title=Voting begins in quake-ravaged Pacific nation of Vanuatu |url=https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/world/vanuatu-election-voting-begins-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=16 January 2025 |work=CNN}}</ref> The Vanuatu Parliament experienced a series of "floor crossings" by members of parliament which led to levels of uncertainty. In an effort to prevent this from occurring, and thereby preserve political stability, Vanuatu held a referendum in [[2024 Vanuatuan constitutional referendum|May 2024]] adopting two new constitutional provisions. The first would force a member of parliament who leaves or is expelled from the party under which they were elected to resign their seat which would then be filled by a [[by-election]]. The second would require elected independents and individuals elected as the only member of their party to join a larger party represented in parliament within three months of the first session. Both measures passed by large margins. Understanding the frustration regarding political instability, some candidates have run on a platform to end political instability with independent candidate [[Mike Esrom Kaun]] stating "[p]eople are frustrated, are tired and realize that something has to happen and this has been amplified by the disaster that recently happened."<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 January 2025 |title=Vanuatu holds snap election as nation braces for costly post-earthquake reconstruction effort |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-16/vanuatu-election-earthquake-recovery-political-instability/104804378 |access-date=16 January 2025 |work=ABC News}}</ref> 

Economic development may also be a factor for some voters. In 2024, the [[European Union]] ended Vanuatu's visa-free access, after previously suspending it in 2022, citing security concerns.<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 December 2024 |title=Vanuatu: Council ends visa exemption |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/12/vanuatu-council-ends-visa-exemption/ |access-date=16 January 2025 |work=European Council}}</ref> Specifically, the EU alleged that Vanuatu has been operating investor citizenship schemes. These schemes enabled third-country nationals who would otherwise be required to have a visa when travelling to the EU to receive Vanuatu citizenship in exchange for an investment, thereby obtaining visa-free access to the EU. This created security concerns for the EU. Since the suspension revenue related to the Vanuatu's citizenship scheme has dropped.<ref>{{Cite news |date=16 January 2025 |title=Vanuatu holds snap election a month after destructive earthquake |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/vanuatu-holds-snap-election-a-month-after-destructive-earthquake/ |access-date=16 January 2025 |work=Seattle Times}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The 52 members of [[Parliament of Vanuatu|Parliament]] are elected for four years terms by [[single non-transferable vote]] in eighteen constituencies, ten of which are multi-member constituencies of between two and seven seats, while the remaining eight are single-member constituencies in which the member is elected through the [[first-past-the-post]] system.<ref>[http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/3276/ Republic of Vanuatu: Election for Ni-Vanuatu Parliament] IFES</ref>

==Candidates==
Altogether 217 candidates ran in the election, including seven women.<ref name="candidates">{{Cite news |date=10 January 2025 |title=Vanuatu snap election to be contested by 217 candidates |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/538610/vanuatu-snap-election-to-be-contested-by-217-candidates |access-date=10 January 2025 |work=Radio New Zealand}}</ref>

==Results==
Initial results released on 18 January showed the [[Leaders Party of Vanuatu]] with a plurality of 11 seats in parliament, followed by the [[Vanua'aku Party]] with seven seats, and [[Union of Moderate Parties]] and the [[Reunification Movement for Change]] with six seats each, the [[Iauko Group]] with five seats and the [[Land and Justice Party]] winning four seats.<ref name="coalition">{{Cite news |date=20 January 2025 |title=Coalition talks underway in Vanuatu |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/539443/coalition-talks-underway-in-vanuatu |access-date=20 January 2025 |work=Radio New Zealand}}</ref> Official results were released on 29 January.<ref name="official"/>
