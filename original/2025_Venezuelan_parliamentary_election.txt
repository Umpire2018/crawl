==Electoral system==
The 277 members of the National Assemnbly are elected using a [[parallel voting]] system, with 144 seats elected by [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] (with seats allocated using the [[d'Hondt method]]) and 133 seats elected by [[first-past-the-post voting]] in 87 constituencies.<ref name="efecto">{{cite news |date=3 July 2020 |title=CNE divulga cronograma electoral y número de diputados por estado |url=https://efectococuyo.com/politica/cne-divulga-cronograma-electoral-y-numero-de-diputados-por-estados/ |language=es |agency=[[Efecto Cocuyo]]}}</ref>

The election was originally set to be held on 27 April. However on 19 February 2025, the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] moved the election date to 25 May, saying that it was needed to "facilitate and promote the participation of different actors" in the electoral process.<ref name="election"/>

==Reactions==
Opposition politicians have called for a boycott of the election. [[Maria Corina Machado]] said that participating in "a farce imposed by [[Nicolas Maduro|Maduro]] is to disregard the mandate" given by voters to the opposition following the disputed [[2024 Venezuelan presidential election]]. [[Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia]], who claimed victory in the presidential election, said said holding the election was "unviable" and "contradicts the mandate expressed by Venezuelans at the polls" in the previous year.<ref name="election"/>
