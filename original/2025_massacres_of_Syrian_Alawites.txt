{{Ahmed al-Sharaa series}}

A series of [[mass killing]]s and [[massacre]]s against [[Alawites]] occurred in [[Syria]] from 6 March 2025 to 17 March 2025, with a resurgence in early April. They were part of communal and sectarian violence by fighters aligned with the [[Syrian caretaker government|Syrian transitional government]] (including locally mobilised civilians, [[Syrian National Army]] (SNA) militias and [[Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah]]), in addition to armed remnants of the former [[Assad regime]]. The typical pattern of the attacks involved armed gunmen showing up at civilians' doors, interrogating them by asking whether they are Alawite or Sunni, and then targeting and killing them based solely on their response. The events followed [[Western Syria clashes (March 2025–present)#6 March|large-scale attacks]] by pro-Assad insurgents on 6 March as well as the ongoing [[Western Syria clashes (December 2024–present)|clashes in Western Syria]] in the [[Syrian civil war]]. 

As of 17 March 2025, the UK-based [[Syrian Network for Human Rights]] (SNHR) reported that 1,084 people, including civilians and fighters, were killed in the clashes since 6 March. According to their documentation, at least 639 people, including civilians and disarmed combatants have been killed by forces aligned with the Syrian transitional government.

Especially deadly massacres began in early March 2025 in [[Latakia Governorate]], where, according to the SOHR, Syrian security forces killed hundreds of civilians over the span of two days, including 52 Alawite individuals in the towns of [[Al-Mukhtariya]] and [[Al-Shir]] in rural Latakia alone. These events took place during a period of heightened tensions and [[March 2025 Western Syria clashes|armed clashes]] between Syrian transitional government forces and militants that are loyal to former [[Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]], as described by Syrian authorities. Despite assurances by new government officials that minorities would be safe in the new Syria, Alawite communities have been subject to a number of massacres since December 2024.

Syrian president [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] denied responsibility in March 2025 for the attacks. In his speech, al-Sharaa said that "remnants of the former regime" had no choice but to surrender immediately as he vowed to hold accountable "anyone involved in civilian bloodshed".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Syria's leader forms committee to probe deadly clashes, vows accountability |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/9/syria-forms-committee-to-investigate-coastal-violence-outbreak |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250314104244/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/9/syria-forms-committee-to-investigate-coastal-violence-outbreak |archive-date=14 March 2025 |access-date=9 March 2025 |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |language=en}}</ref> He later vowed to punish anyone involved in the killings, saying that Assad loyalists and associated foreign powers committed the killings as means to destabilize the Syrian state and restart civil war.

== Background ==
{{Further information|Western Syria clashes (December 2024–present)}}
Coastal Syria, and especially the [[Latakia Governorate]], has historically served as the heartland of [[Syria]]'s [[Alawites|Alawite]] community, a minority religious group which is considered an offshoot or a sect of [[Shia Islam]], which comprises around 10% of the entire Syrian population. The [[Assad family]], which ruled Syria for decades, belonged to this religious minority, giving a small number of its members positions within the regime (especially those members who were closely tied to the Assad family and those members who served in the loyalist [[Shabiha]] militias and were involved in [[organised crime]] such as the [[Captagon]] trade), while it was suppressing dissent in the community and it was also portraying itself as the defender of minorities against the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslim majority. However, the Assad government under [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar]] had increasingly become unpopular among Alawites due to its corruption and the economic collapse.<ref>{{cite web |last=Christou |first=William |title='Celebrating the unknown': Syrian Alawites fear for future under rebel rule |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 December 2024 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/celebrating-the-unknown-syrian-alawites-fear-for-future-under-rebel-rule |access-date=10 March 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250314000808/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/celebrating-the-unknown-syrian-alawites-fear-for-future-under-rebel-rule |archive-date=14 March 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Pacchiani |first=Gianluca |title=Once the power holders under Assad, Syria's Alawites now fear for their fates |work=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=19 December 2024 |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/once-the-power-holders-under-assad-syrias-alawites-now-fear-for-their-fates/ |access-date=10 March 2025 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20241219153439/https://www.timesofisrael.com/once-the-power-holders-under-assad-syrias-alawites-now-fear-for-their-fates/ |archive-date=19 December 2024}}</ref><ref name="w379"/>

After the establishment of a transitional government under then-[[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS) emir [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]], a "mosaic" of new security forces was installed across the region by the new government, including: the more disciplined and professional General Security units of the former [[Syrian Salvation Government]]'s HTS-controlled Ministry of Interior in the most heavily minority-dominated areas such as Latakia and [[Jableh]] in Latakia governorate; [[Military Operations Command]] units (including some [[Foreign fighters in the Syrian civil war|Islamist foreign fighters]]) which were pulled out of the cities to rural areas in late December due to their lack of restraint, one unit of [[Fursan Sharqiyah]] fighters affiliated to the Turkish-backed SNA, deployed in Tartous; and local factions returning to hometowns from which they had been displaced during the [[Syrian civil war|civil war]], e.g. in [[Salamiyah]], [[Talkalakh]], [[Al-Qusayr District|Qusayr]], and [[Homs|Homs city]].<ref name="s844"/> Servicemen from Assad's armed forces, including volunteers and conscripts, returned to their hometowns, making settlements with the new security services to gain civilian status.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Yogita |last=Limaye |date=29 December 2024 |title=Post-Assad Syria: Former soldiers give up their weapons for papers |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n35j5340o |access-date=15 March 2025 |work=[[BBC News]] |language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250308051221/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n35j5340o |archive-date=8 March 2025}}</ref>

In mid-December, HTS sources stated that armed criminals who were connected to the old regime were involved in looting and lawlessness in the coastal region.

During the operation, the attackers set seven houses on fire and murdered six civilians.

SOHR reported what they said was testimony of a survivor of massacres committed in two villages of al-Fuqara in the countryside of [[Qardaha]] reported on the "[[Ethnic cleansing|sectarian cleansing]]" of the villages, alleging the killing of over 150 unarmed men and youth between the ages of 13 and 85. He claimed that the villages, predominantly inhabited by Alawite residents, had welcomed the new Syrian government following the fall of Assad's regime. He said that violence began on 6 March at approximately 6:00 p.m., when security personnel positioned at a [[Security checkpoint|checkpoint]] on the main road began firing randomly toward the villages, described as an attempt to provoke residents into returning fire to provide justification for a military-style intervention. He said villagers remained in their homes in fear and did not retaliate with any gunfire.<ref name="sohr13marchsf">{{Cite web |date=13 March 2025 |script-title=ar:العناصر الأمنية في مواجهة مدنيين عُزَّل.. ناجٍ من إحدى المجازر يروي للمرصد السوري تفاصيل مروعة: في قريتَي الفقراء، القتل كان ممنهجاً |title=aleanasir al'amniat fi muajahat madaniiyn euzal.. naj min 'iihdaa almajazir yarwi lilmarsad alsuwrii tafasil murawieatan: fi qrytay alfuqara'i, alqatl kan mmnhjaan |trans-title=Security forces confront unarmed civilians.

He said that in the early morning hours of 7 March, substantial military convoys arrived from various Syrian provinces. By 5:00 a.m., he said he estimated 4,000 armed individuals equipped with [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]], including Kalashnikov rifles, had assembled near the village entrance. These forces were supported by [[van]]s mounted with [[machine gun]]s. At approximately 6:00 a.m., he said, the armed groups initiated heavy gunfire directed at residential structures while inhabitants remained inside. Following this initial assault, he said that the perpetrators, comprising two distinct factions targeting each village, began systematic house-to-house operations. He said that males aged thirteen and above were specifically targeted and separated from women and younger children, and that these individuals were then methodically subjected either to immediate field executions conducted outside their residences, or being forced to crawl to the village square before being shot. He alleged that the perpetrators employed additional methods of killing, which included premeditated [[Torture|torture techniques]] such as breaking civilians' backs and [[trampling]] them, as well as [[Mutilation|mutilation tactics]] such as [[Eye-gouging|gouging]] out eyes and [[Dismemberment|dismembering]] limbs with [[saw]]s. In one instance, he said, an [[Disease|infirm man]] was forcibly removed from his sickbed before being executed outside his home. He heard armes individuals shouting anti-Alawite slogans such as "Alawites and pigs, we will exterminate you" during the operations. He said sectarian songs were sung while victims were being led to execution sites. Following the executions, he said, secondary groups entered the villages with the apparent objective of [[Property damage|property destruction]] and [[theft]]. He alleged that individuals systematically looted valuable possessions from residences, destroyed items that could not be removed, and burned numerous structures. According to the SOHR, the massacre appears to have been part of a premeditated plan aimed at both [[Genocidal massacre|extermination]] and [[Forced displacement|displacement]] of the remaining Alawite population in the area.<ref name="sohr13marchsf"/>

===== Hama Governorate =====
In rural areas of [[Hama Governorate]], similar violence occurred. In the Alawite village of [[Arzah]], approximately one hundred armed individuals from the neighboring Sunni village of [[Khitab]] reportedly entered the community around 2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST after [[Friday prayer]]s. According to survivors, village security forces attempted to prevent the incursion by firing warning shots before being overwhelmed. The village pharmacist was allegedly the first to be executed, followed by systematic house-to-house killings involving [[AK-47]]s that resulted in 24 deaths, including two women. Khitab [[imam]] and [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] figure [[Abu Jaber]] indirectly claimed responsibility for the massacre on Arzah on 7 March. He expressed that it was necessary to "[[Ethnic cleansing|cleanse]]" the area of Alawite settlements, and stated that it would be the nearby Alawite village of [[Rabia, Syria|Rabia]]'s "turn" next. Several atrocities were reported in [[Tishrin, Hama|Tishrin]] in Hama province, including a video of a man being thrown out of his car before being "violently trampled".

SOHR alleged that the interim government had implemented significant restrictions on media access to the country's coastal provinces. It alleged that journalists and international media organizations were prohibited from entering the coastal areas, and that existing foreign media personnel were ordered to depart the country within thirty days. According to SOHR, only specific media organizations perceived as sympathetic to the new government were permitted to enter designated areas within the coastal region for reporting purposes. The SOHR said that sources had told it that authorities were restricting the movement of relief teams and humanitarian aid into coastal cities affected by violence. The SOHR characterized the access limitations as "part of a systematic effort to conceal evidence of [[war crime]]s and [[genocide]]," arguing that restricting journalists' movements represented "a systematic policy to obscure the facts and prevent documentation of violations." The organization said that the isolation of the sites of the massacres from the international community would "paves the way for forced demographic change and the [[Tampering with evidence|obliteration of evidence]] of [[crimes against humanity]]." It expressed concern that the combination of media restrictions and limitations on humanitarian access could exacerbate suffering in affected communities, while simultaneously reducing international awareness of and response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 March 2025 |script-title=ar:قيود تهدف إلى طمس أدلة الإبادة الجماعية.. المرصد السوري يدين منع الصحفيين الأجانب من دخول الساحل |title=quyud tahdif 'iilaa tams 'adilat al'iibadat aljamaeiati.. almarsad alsuwriu yudin mane alsahafiiyn al'ajanib min dukhul alsaahil |trans-title=Restrictions aimed at obliterating evidence of genocide: Syrian Observatory condemns ban on foreign journalists from entering the Sahel |url=https://www.syriahr.com/%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B7%D9%85%D8%B3-%D8%A3%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A/753022/ |website=[[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] |access-date=14 March 2025 |language=ar |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

One showed several individuals identified as Ministry of Defense personnel inside an Alawite residence in an unknown village.

The SOHR reported receiving information demonstrating that Syrian Ministry of Defense forces deliberately set fires across the Latakia countryside. Videos sent to the SOHR showed Ministry of Defense forces setting a fire in a village in the countryside of Qardaha. The acts of arson created massive [[conflagration]]s spreading across wide areas of the Latakia countryside, resulting in the [[Deforestation|destruction of forests]], [[agricultural land]], as well as both public and private buildings and property. The fires also caused widespread destruction of forests and villages in the Qardaha countryside, with massive plumes of smoke reported. The SOHR stated that in addition to the significant threat posed to agriculture and the [[Environmental issues in Syria|environment]], that the fires endangered the lives of civilians who evacuated from their residences to the forests to escape systematic killings.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 March 2025 |script-title=ar:حرائق كارثية تلتهم قرى في ريف اللاذقية وتهدد حياة المدنيين |title=harayiq karithiat taltahim quraa fi rif allaadhiqiat watuhadid hayaat almadaniiyn |trans-title=Catastrophic fires engulf villages in the Latakia countryside, threatening the lives of civilians |url=https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B0%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9/753037/ |website=[[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] |access-date=14 March 2025 |language=ar |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

===== Alleged misinformation campaign =====
The SOHR alleged the existence of a coordinated online campaign attempting to [[Historical revisionism|reframe]] the massacres against Alawite civilians as bilateral conflict between opposing forces rather than [[Targeted killing|targeted attacks]] against a specific community. It alleged that the campaign appeared to coordinate posting patterns, [[Hashtag|hashtag manipulation]], and the [[Social bot|artificial amplification]] of specific narratives, and particularly focused on [[Disadvantaged|economically disadvantaged areas]] with significant Alawite populations. It said the campaign appeared designed to complicate attribution of responsibility by suggesting that violence was occurring on all sides at the site of the massacres in order to help government forces evade responsibility, and that the campaign appeared to try to influence foreign governments' and organizations' understanding of events to minimize international intervention, and to create an impression of popular support for actions against Alawite communities in Damascus. The SOHR said that these narrative manipulation efforts sought to "obscure the truth about the genocide being perpetrated against the Alawites in the Sahel [coastal region]," potentially undermining accountability mechanisms for those responsible for violence. The observatory also condemned the lack of effort in stopping "[[hate speech]] and [[Incitement to genocide|incitement to murder]]" since the fall of Assad.<ref>{{Cite web |date=14 March 2025 |script-title=ar:بالتزامن مع المجازر المرتكبة في الساحل السوري.. إطلاق حملة إعلامية عبر الإنترنت تستهدف الأحياء الفقيرة التي يقطنها أبناء من الطائفة العلوية في دمشق |title=bialtazamun mae almajazir almurtakibat fi alsaahil alsuwrii..

SOHR reported that sources told it that Russian forces agreed to bury three bodies at the Khmeimim base. One body was believed to be of a man who had been shot on Khmeimim Bridge; the two others were believed to be those of a woman and her daughter, struck by a drone in their car as they attempted to escape from ongoing violence near a shop towards the refuge of the Khmeimim base.

SOHR reported that Syrian government authorities dispatched transportation to relocate Alawite families taking refuge at the Russia-controlled Khmeimim base back to their houses. However, the families refused evacuation, citing their profound distrust of government authorities following what they described as genocidal actions against their communities and the lack of adequate protection guarantees. Many families expressed their fear of becoming victimized by continued violence upon return to their home regions, amid reports of continued targeting of civilians in the Baniyas countryside and nearby regions. Displaced persons at the base reportedly experienced severe shortages of food supplies, essential living necessities, and medical equipment and services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 March 2025 |script-title=ar:سلطات دمشق ترسل حافلات لنقل النازحين من قاعدة حميميم.. والعائلات ترفض المغادرة وتطالب بالحماية |title=sulutat dimashq tursil hafilat linaql alnaazihin min qaeidat hamimim.. waleayilat tarfud almughadarat watutalib bialhimayat |trans-title=Damascus authorities send buses to transport displaced people from the Hmeimim base, but families refuse to leave and demand protection. |url=https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85/753401/ |website=[[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] |access-date=17 March 2025 |language=ar |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

==== Syrian Druze community ====
On 13 March 2025, [[Hikmat al-Hijri]], the spiritual leader of the [[Druze in Syria|Druze community in Syria]], made "unprecedentedly harsh" public statements rejecting any cooperation with the transitional government in Damascus, stating the community had "no agreement or consensus" with al-Sharaa's government. His remarks during a meeting in [[Suwayda Governorate]] characterized the administration as "[[Extremism|extremist]] in every sense of the word and wanted by [[International law|international justice]]" in reference to the massacres. He stated that the Druze community was in a state of whether to "be or not be", and declared the community's determination to pursue its own interests independently based on the [[rule of law]].<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ar:"مطلوبة للعدالة الدولية".. زعيم دروز سوريا يهاجم حكومة دمشق {{!}} الحرة |title="matlubat lileadalat alduwaliati".. zaeim duruz suria yuhajim hukumat dimashq {{!}} alhura |trans-title=In unprecedentedly harsh statements, a Druze leader in Syria attacks the Damascus government. |url=https://www.alhurra.com/syria/2025/03/13/%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B2%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82 |access-date=13 March 2025 |website=Al Hurra |language=ar |archive-url=https://archive.today/20250314160025/https://www.alhurra.com/syria/2025/03/13/%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B2%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82 |archive-date=14 March 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ar:في تصريحات "مفاجئة"... شيخ عقل الدروز: لا وفاق ولا توافق مع سوريا |title=fi tasrihat "mufajiati"... shaykh eaql alduruz: la wifaq wala tawafiq mae suria |trans-title=In "surprising" statements, the Druze Sheikh Aql said: "There is no agreement or consensus with Syria." |url=https://www.lebanondebate.com/news/689336 |access-date=13 March 2025 |website=Lebanon Debate |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250314090811/https://www.lebanondebate.com/news/689336 |archive-date=14 March 2025}}</ref>

Likewise, [[Bahaa al-Jamal]], commander of Druze operations in Suwayda,{{clarify|what does this mean?|date=March 2025}} publicly rejected Syria's new constitutional declaration. The commander criticized the exclusion of Druze representatives from the constitutional process such as al-Hajri, and asserted that the document lacked legitimacy without Druze community involvement. al-Jamal declared that the Druze community did not recognize Ahmad al-Sharaa as president of Syria, stating that they did not recognize a "[[Terrorism|terrorist]]" who was not elected through [[free and fair election]]s. He specifically condemned the massacres of Alawites, emphasizing that the victims were unarmed civilians and not "remnants of the [Assad] regime" as stated in the official narratives of HTS and al-Sharaa. He stated that the Druze had substantial military capability with "thousands of military personnel," and stated that they had the right to defend themselves if confronted by government forces.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Syria's Druze spiritual leader slams new Syrian leadership as 'extremist' |url=https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/130320256 |access-date=14 March 2025 |website=[[Rudaw]] |date=14 March 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250314090605/https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/130320256 |archive-date=14 March 2025}}</ref>

==== Demonstrations ====
On 9 March, activists in [[Damascus]] organized a "silent demonstration", mourning the mass killing of citizens and the deaths of government security forces during the clashes, and advocating for national unity. Approximately several dozen people gathered for this memorial protest, with some participants displaying placards stating "Syrian lives are not cheap."<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="bbc">{{Cite news |title=Syria latest: UN urges Syria to act fast to protect people as hundreds of civilians killed |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c8e7y7ykd01t |access-date=9 March 2025 |work=[[BBC News]] |language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250310144552/https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c8e7y7ykd01t |archive-date=10 March 2025}}</ref>

This initial gathering was soon confronted by counter-demonstrators who chanted anti-Alawite sentiments and called for a "[[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] state." Physical altercations erupted between the opposing groups of protesters, with counter-protesters accusing initial protesters of ignoring the slaughter of Sunni Muslims under Assad's regime. Members of the original protests responded by stating that they could settle "your score with Assad, we have nothing to do with his crimes." Security forces intervened to end the confrontation, firing [[warning shot]]s into the air to disperse the crowds.<ref name="rfi">{{Cite news |date=9 March 2025 |title=Syria security forces disperse rival protests in Damascus |url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/international-news/20250309-syria-security-forces-disperse-rival-protests-in-damascus |access-date=9 March 2025 |work=[[Radio France Internationale]] |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250310144554/https://www.rfi.fr/en/international-news/20250309-syria-security-forces-disperse-rival-protests-in-damascus |archive-date=10 March 2025}}</ref><ref name="bbc"/>

Also on 9 March, activists in the mainly-[[Druze]] city of [[Suwayda]] organized a demonstration in Al-Karamah Square condemning the sectarian-oriented massacres against coastal Syrians, and demanded an end to state violence and reprisals towards civilians. Many protesters carried banners juxtaposing the then-ongoing massacres alongside prior massacres under the Assad regime. Several protesters and residents articulated that it is a crime to kill civilians no matter who the perpetrator was, and insisted that the [[Syrian revolution]] against the Assad regime was for "a dignified life, not for revenge".<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 March 2025 |script-title=ar:"لا لعمليات الانتقام الطائفي".. وقفة احتجاجية في السويداء لإيقاف المجازر في الساحل السوري |title="la lieamaliaat alaintiqam altaayifii".. waqfat aihtijajiat fi alsuwayda' li'iiqaf almajazir fi alsaahil alsuwrii |trans-title="No to sectarian revenge operations" A protest stand in Sweida to stop the massacres on the Syrian coast |url=https://www.syriahr.com/%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA/752487/ |website=[[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] |access-date=10 March 2025 |language=ar |script-quote=ar:للحياة الكريمة لا للثأر |quote=lilhayat alkarimat la lilthaar |trans-quote=For a decent life, not for revenge |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

She believed that there would be no reason for Syrian civilians to trust any findings of the government if the process was not fully [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] or not conducted with independent international organizations. She stated that President al-Sharaa's words vowing justice against perpetrators would mean little without the participation of victims, an upholding of equal [[human rights]] for all communities, and for making sure that "never again really means never again".<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 March 2025 |title=Syria: Horrific killings of civilians on northwest coast must be investigated |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/03/syria-horrific-killings-of-civilians-on-northwest-coast-must-be-investigated/ |access-date=12 March 2025 |website=[[Amnesty International]] |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250312161522/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/03/syria-horrific-killings-of-civilians-on-northwest-coast-must-be-investigated/ |archive-date=12 March 2025}}</ref> In a separate statement dated 3 April 2025, the organization stated that it had investigated 32 of the killings and concluded that they were deliberate, targeted at the Alawite minority sect, and unlawful.
