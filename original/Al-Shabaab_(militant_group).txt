Formed in the mid-2000s as a youth militia within the wider military wing of the [[Islamic Courts Union]], al-Shabaab came to prominence during the 2006–2009 [[Somalia War (2006–2009)|Ethiopian invasion and occupation of Somalia]], during which it presented itself as a vehicle for the waging of armed resistance against the occupying Ethiopian army. In subsequent years, it gained popular support from [[Somalis]] and became a dominant force in south and central Somalia, defending large swathes of territory by fighting against the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] and the [[Federal Government of Somalia]], as well as the latter's [[Transitional Federal Government of Somalia|transitional predecessor]]. Al-Shabaab gained international prominence due to its recruitment of foreign fighters, including fighters who are from [[Western world|Western countries]]. Countries including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] have designated it as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist organization]], and the United States has [[American military intervention in Somalia (2007–present)|militarily intervened]] in order to fight against the group.

Between 2011 and 2013, a coalition of [[African Union]] forces, led by the Somali government, wrested a significant amount of territory from al-Shabaab, including the capital city, [[Mogadishu]]. During the same period, the group was plagued by internal conflicts over its leadership and ideological direction, which intensified when, in February 2012, al-Shabaab's leadership [[Bay'ah|pledged allegiance]] to al-Qaeda. It suffered further military losses in 2014, as a result of [[Operation Indian Ocean]], and the killing of its [[emir]], [[Ahmed Abdi Godane]]. Several years thereafter, al-Shabaab retreated from the major cities, but it remained influential in many rural areas, and it prioritized [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Terrorism|terror]] attacks over territorial acquisitions. It is responsible for many high-fatality attacks, including the [[Westgate shopping mall attack|2013 Westgate attack]], [[14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings|October 2017 Mogadishu bombings]] and the [[2022 Somali Ministry of Education bombings]]. Apart from its activities in Somalia, the group also operates in neighboring countries, extending its insurgency to Kenya's border regions with its [[Jaysh Ayman]] wing<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-10 |title=Maalim Ayman: A Post-Mortem of al-Shabaab's Commander Tasked with Attacking Kenya |url=https://jamestown.org/brief/maalim-ayman-a-post-mortem-of-al-shabaabs-commander-tasked-with-attacking-kenya/ |access-date=2024-08-27 |website=jamestown.org |language=en-US}}</ref> and carrying out a [[2022 al-Shabaab invasion of Ethiopia|major incursion into Ethiopia]] in 2022.

== Organisation and structure ==
{{Jihadism sidebar}}

=== Origins ===
Although it is unclear when al-Shabaab was formed, it is understood to have originated as a youth militia within the military wing of the [[Islamic Courts Union]], an umbrella group which provided ''de facto'' governance in much of Somalia until the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|country was invaded by Ethiopia]] in December 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cocodia |first=Jude |date=2021-04-03 |title=Rejecting African Solutions to African Problems: The African Union and the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19392206.2021.1922026 |journal=African Security |language=en |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=110–131 |doi=10.1080/19392206.2021.1922026 |issn=1939-2206}}</ref>{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}}{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}} In 2007–08, al-Shabaab established itself as an independent actor, gaining prominence as a vehicle of armed resistance against the Ethiopian [[military occupation]].{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}}{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}} Many of its early leaders and members previously belonged not only to the Islamic Courts Union but also to the older [[Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya|al-Ittihad al-Islamiya]], a group founded on the tenets of [[Salafi movement|Salafism]] and opposition to [[Somalis#Clans|clannism]].{{Sfn|Barnett|2020}} Many early al-Shabaab leaders had also been trained as [[mujahideen]] in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Syria]].

=== Ideology ===
According to the [[International Crisis Group]], Salafism has been a core unifying principle of al-Shabaab, although this principle is not interpreted uniformly by the group's members and leaders.{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} In particular, al-Shabaab officially and generally advocates a form of [[Salafi jihadism]] with transnational aims, linking [[Somali nationalism|Somali nationalist]] and local grievances to the plight of [[Muslims]] worldwide.{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} Academics have also noted the influence of non-Salafi Islamic movements in Somalia on al-Shabaab.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marchal |first=Roland |date=March 2011 |title=The rise of a Jihadi movement in a country at war: Harkat al-Shabaab al Mujaheddin in Somalia |url=https://www.sciencespo.fr/ceri/sites/sciencespo.fr.ceri/files/art_RM2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514085525/https://www.sciencespo.fr/ceri/sites/sciencespo.fr.ceri/files/art_RM2.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2014 |website=SciencesPo |pages=12}}</ref>

Following its pan-Islamist political outlook, incursions into Somalia by Ethiopia – and later by Kenya, the United States, and others – are viewed by al-Shabaab as part of a wider American-sponsored [[war against Islam]].{{Sfn|Barnett|2020}}{{sfn|Vidino|Pantucci|Kohlmann|2010}} For instance, al-Shabaab denounced the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia]] as a "Zionist-Crusader aggression",{{Sfn|Barnett|2020}} in which the United States "unleashed its ‘hunting dogs’ in Ethiopia and Kenya" by deploying "the world's crusader forces" to counter the rise of the [[Islamic Courts Union]].{{sfn|Vidino|Pantucci|Kohlmann|2010|p=222}} However, this globalist framework is not universal within the group,{{sfn|Schaefer|2011}}<ref name="counterterrorism">[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111shrg49640/html/CHRG-111shrg49640.htm Senate Hearing 111–678: Violent Islamic Extremism—2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109060737/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111shrg49640/html/CHRG-111shrg49640.htm |date=November 9, 2020 }}.

U.S. Government Printing Office. 2009.</ref> an ideological fault-line which has sometimes fostered [[Political faction|factionalism]] and internal conflict. Much of al-Shabaab's Somali support base is fiercely nationalist, and sees as its primary goal the establishment of a stable Islamic state inside Somalia,{{sfn|Vidino|Pantucci|Kohlmann|2010}}{{sfn|Solomon|2014}} or, more ambitiously, inside so-called [[Greater Somalia]], uniting the ethnic Somali populations of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti.{{sfn|Petrich|2022}} Other domestic supporters are concerned primarily with clan-related and local objectives, and are therefore prone to infighting and shifting alliances.<ref name="Asnctc">{{cite web |title=Al-Shabaab |url=http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/al_shabaab.html |url-status=dead |access-date=28 March 2013 |publisher=[[National Counterterrorism Center]] |archive-date=May 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524014136/http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/al_shabaab.html }}</ref>

However, these ideological differences can accommodate broad opposition within the group to common adversaries – notably opposition to external intervention in Somalia, often publicly expressed in quasi-[[Qutbism|Qutbist]] terms;<ref>{{cite web |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=30 May 2017 |title=Shabaab claims US is 'Satan of our time,' praises al Qaeda's leadership |url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/05/shabaab-claims-us-is-satan-of-our-time-praises-al-qaedas-leadership.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118055727/https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/05/shabaab-claims-us-is-satan-of-our-time-praises-al-qaedas-leadership.php |archive-date=18 January 2022 |website=[[The Long War Journal]]}}</ref> and opposition to the internationally recognised [[Federal Government of Somalia|Somali government]], which, lacking a basis in religious ([[Sharia]]) law, is seen to lack legitimacy.{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} Al-Shabaab hardliners broadly adhere to a [[Takfiri]] interpretation of the principle of ''[[Al-Wala' wal-Bara'|al-wala' wal-bara'<nowiki/>]]'' ({{literal translation|loyalty and disavowal}}),{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}}{{sfn|Alkaff|2013}} insofar as it prescribes dissociation from non-Muslims and those perceived as [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]].<ref name="Joscelyn2019" />

A major component of Al-Shabaab's ideology is [[Somalis|Somali]] [[religious nationalism]] which is incorporated into its [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] cause. [[Patriotism|Patriotic]] themes warning Somalis of the plots from international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], "[[Crusades|Christian Crusaders]]" ([[United States]], [[Ethiopia]], [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]]) and their collaborators are a regular feature of the movement's propaganda. During the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|Ethiopian invasion of Somalia]], Al-Shabaab positioned itself as a staunch nationalist militia under the Islamic ''[[Muqawamah|Muqawwama]]'' (resistance coalition) of the [[Islamic Courts Union]], taking the most hardline stance against the invading "Christian crusaders". After the collapse of the ICU in 2007, Al-Shabaab launched its own independent insurgency, gaining popular support from Somalis for defending the country from [[American imperialism]] and foreign occupation.

=== Membership ===
Especially in its early years, al-Shabaab was sometimes characterised by Somali opponents as dominated by the [[Hawiye]] clan, which is one of the largest [[Somali clan|clans in Somalia]].{{sfn|Schaefer|2011}} Hawiye remain influential in the group,{{Sfn|Bacon|2022}} and, according to a 2018 analysis by the Somali Hiraal Institute, five of the ten members of the executive shura council were Hawiye, as were about 94 of the top 220 officials.{{Sfn|Mubarak|2018}} However, al-Shabaab is attached to an ethos of anti-clannism, and has therefore tried to appeal to minority groups and to ensure ethnic and clan diversity among its leadership.{{sfn|Chonka|2016b}} It incorporates a relatively large contingent of [[foreign fighter]]s {{See below|{{section link|#Foreign recruitment}}}}. Rank-and-file members, though sometimes recruited by force,<ref name="Asnctc" /> are also attracted by the regular pay that al-Shabaab offers and by its political [[propaganda]].{{sfn|Chonka|2016b}} In the past, many young al-Shabaab recruits were drawn from marginalised southern clans, such as the [[Somali Bantus|Jareer]].{{sfn|Chonka|2016b}}<ref>{{cite news |author=Abdul-Ahad |first=Ghaith |date=June 7, 2010 |title=How Somalia's civil war became new front in battle against al-Qaida |work=The Guardian |location= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/07/somalia-civil-war-al-qaida |access-date=January 14, 2012 |archive-date=September 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915013547/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/07/somalia-civil-war-al-qaida |url-status=live }}</ref> Many are [[Children in the military|children]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Regilme |first1=Salvador Santino Jr Fulo |last2=Spoldi |first2=Elisabetta |date=2021-07-01 |title=Children in Armed Conflict: A Human Rights Crisis in Somalia |journal=Global Jurist |language=en |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=365–402 |doi=10.1515/gj-2020-0083 |s2cid=232245779 |issn=1934-2640|doi-access=free |hdl=1887/3154491 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

In the initial years, many Somalis perceived Al-Shabaab as disciplined, orderly, and fair, which earned the group significant legitimacy. However, this perception was later lost due to their arbitrary rulings.<ref name=":222" /> Heavy handed tactics by the Ethiopian military rallied many Somalis to support the organization, and over the following two years al-Shabaab became battle hardened as it participated in the insurgency. In this period, the group laid the foundation for an enduring insurgency in Somalia, establishing networks and territorial bases concentrated in the rural south-central regions.<ref name=":27" />{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} The African Union reported Al-Shabaab was about 2,000 fighters strong during 2008.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Hummel |first=Kristina |date=2024-04-30 |title=The Somali National Army Versus al-Shabaab: A Net Assessment |url=https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-somali-national-army-versus-al-shabaab-a-net-assessment/ |access-date=2024-06-30 |website=[[Combating Terrorism Center at West Point]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

A critical juncture in transformation of Al-Shabaab was the assassination of the groups military leader [[Aden Hashi Farah Ayro|Aden Hashi Ayro]] in an American airstrike during May 2008. It resulted in several significant developments for Al-Shabaab, most prominently the accession of [[Ahmed Abdi Godane|Ahmed Godane]] to leadership of the organization. Godane moved Al-Shabaab in a far more violent direction, alienating many fighters and civilian supporters. The assassination of Ayro did nothing to prevent the groups expansion.<ref name=":27" /> The withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in January 2009 significantly diminished the public support that al-Shabaab had previously enjoyed as a resistance faction.<ref name=":30" /> However, this move came too late to have a substantial impact on the group's transformation into a formidable oppositional force.<ref name=":27" />

=== 2009–10: Dominance in the south ===
{{See also|Somali Civil War (2009–present)}}Having made important territorial gains from mid-2008, al-Shabaab increasingly focused its attention on opposition to the Somali [[Transitional Federal Government of Somalia|Transitional Federal Government]], as the Ethiopian-led war segued into the next phase of the protracted [[Somali Civil War (2009–present)|Somali Civil War]].{{Sfn|Elliot|Holzer|2009}} By 2009–10, al-Shabaab controlled most of central and southern Somalia (south of the semi-autonomous region of [[Puntland]]), and it had formed administrative structures to govern territories under its control.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}}{{sfn|Anzalone|2013}}{{sfn|Bryden|2014}} It had particular success building relationships with local leaders in order to build cross-clan coalitions, combining its principled anti-clannism with a "pragmatic clannism": a willingness to manipulate clan networks and exploit inter-clan politics.{{sfn|Ingiriis|2018b}}{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2011}}{{sfn|Chonka|2016b}}

By 2009, al-Shabaab started drastically altering its choice of targets and frequency of attacks. The use of [[kidnapping]]s and bombings in urban areas significantly grew in use.<ref name=":27" /> The groups significant support from the [[Somali diaspora]] dwindled in response to the usage of terror tactics.<ref name=":2" />

=== 2011–13: Internal and external challenges ===
[[File:Al Shabaab fighters disengage and lay down arms 03 (8019356109).jpg|thumb|Over 200 al-Shabaab fighters surrender to [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]], September 2012.]]
[[File:Allied Forces in Kismayo.jpg|thumb|Somali and Kenyan troops celebrate al-Shabaab's retreat from [[Kismayo Airport]], 2012.]]
In subsequent years, however, al-Shabaab's strong position was significantly weakened, as – in the context of a [[famine]] in the region and, simultaneously, a military offensive against the group – the group experienced territorial and strategic setbacks in the military arena; an internal struggle over the group's direction and leadership; and, in response to both, a wave of high-profile [[defection]]s.

The group's military fortunes turned with the failure of the August 2010 [[Ramadan]] offensive – the inauguration of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (2010–2011)|Battle of Mogadishu]] – which resulted in heavy al-Shabaab losses.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}} By August 2011, al-Shabaab had announced a "strategic withdrawal" from [[Mogadishu]], although, from outlying districts, it continued to exert influence in the city and to launch deadly [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks against AMISOM and the TFG.{{sfn|Anzalone|2013}} In October and November 2011, Kenya and Ethiopia – partnering with local militias – launched offensives against al-Shabaab strongholds: Kenya's [[Operation Linda Nchi]] on the southern front, while Ethiopia approached from the west. The group lost territory to both armies, notably losing [[Baidoa]] to Ethiopia in February 2012 and [[Battle of Kismayo (2012)|losing]] the port city (and revenue hub) of [[Kismayo]] to Kenya in October 2012.{{sfn|Anzalone|2013}}<ref>{{cite news |author=Will Ross |date=2012-02-22 |title=Somalia al-Shabab militant base of Baidoa captured |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17127353 |access-date=2012-08-04 |archive-date=September 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909130242/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17127353 |url-status=live }}</ref> Military pressures on the group were sustained into 2013.

==== Drought, al-Qaeda, and internal struggle ====
Some al-Shabaab members viewed the 2010 Ramadan offensive as disastrously ill-conceived, and subsequent territorial losses galvanised internal opposition to the leadership of [[Ahmed Abdi Godane]], who was publicly named the group's emir in December 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guled |first=Abdi |date=September 2, 2014 |title=U.S. Strikes Al-Shabab In Somalia, 6 Militants Killed |work=Huffington Post |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/us-strike-somalia_n_5751658.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907005309/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/us-strike-somalia_n_5751658.html |archive-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> As [[2011 East Africa drought|a severe drought]] afflicted the region, critics, generally associated with the leadership of [[Hassan Dahir Aweys]] and [[Mukhtar Robow]],{{sfn|Bryden|2014}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Abukar |first=Hassan M. |date=2 July 2013 |title=Somalia: The Godane coup and the unraveling of Al-Shabaab |url=http://africanarguments.org/2013/07/02/somalia-the-godane-coup-and-the-unraveling-of-al-shabaab-%E2%80%93-by-hassan-m-abukar/ |access-date=6 August 2014 |work=African Arguments |publisher=[[Royal African Society]] |archive-date=August 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804012117/http://africanarguments.org/2013/07/02/somalia-the-godane-coup-and-the-unraveling-of-al-shabaab-%E2%80%93-by-hassan-m-abukar/ |url-status=live }}</ref> opposed al-Shabaab's response to the resulting famine, particularly its obstruction of foreign [[humanitarian aid]] to populations in its territories {{See below|[[#Humanitarian access|below]]}}.<ref name="Csfdafbtas">{{cite news |last=Chothia |first=Farouk |date=August 9, 2011 |title=Could Somali famine deal a fatal blow to al-Shabab? |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14373264 |access-date=January 14, 2012 |archive-date=April 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410025812/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14373264 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |date=8 December 2011 |title=Al-Shabaab Leader Admits Split |work=[[Somalia Report]] |url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1349/Al-Shabaab_Leader_Admits_Split |access-date=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022222915/http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1349/Al-Shabaab_Leader_Admits_Split |archive-date=22 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=1 February 2012 |title=Where in the World is Sheikh Aweys? |url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2675/Where_in_the_World_is_Sheikh_Aweys |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525092847/http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2675/Where_in_the_World_is_Sheikh_Aweys |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |access-date=2012-07-07 |website=Somalia Report |df=mdy-all}}</ref> More broadly, they argued that the group's authoritarian style of governance, and use of violence, were causing the group to lose public support.

Following its territorial losses, al-Shabaab reverted to the tactics of [[asymmetric warfare]], launching guerrilla attacks on AMISOM and government positions and territories.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}}{{sfn|Anzalone|2013}} Southern commander Aweys had announced this new strategy in a media interview shortly after the withdrawal from Mogadishu in August 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-08-12 |title=Al-Shabab Vows to Use Guerilla Tactics in Somalia |url=https://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/08/12/al-shabab-vows-to-use-guerilla-tactics-in-somalia/ |access-date=2022-09-09 |website=VOA News |archive-date=September 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909130252/https://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/08/12/al-shabab-vows-to-use-guerilla-tactics-in-somalia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Al-Shabaab increasingly avoided direct military combat and large battles, in favour of "dictat[ing] the conflict's pace by undertaking smaller ambushes at locations of its own choosing".{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} The group undertook high-profile attacks outside Somalia such as the [[Westgate shopping mall attack]] by four militants left 67 dead - the deadliest attack in Kenya since the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 US embassy bombings in Nairobi]].  That death-toll was exceeded two years later in the Garissa University College attack in which 148 people were killed in an attack targeting Christian students. Furthermore, two sophisticated attempts to target airliners were observed in 2016. In February a device in a laptop bag that had passed screening was detonated mid-flight, killing only the bomber, and in March another laptop bomb exploded during screening. Reacting to apparent advances in the group’s bomb-making capabilities, the UN Security Council later prohibited the transfer of bomb components to Somalia. The group has also developed a strategy of maintaining a "semi-territorial presence" in key regions and parts of key cities: while it no longer had exclusive and military authority over substantial territory, it retained a sporadic presence, and therefore significant influence, in many places.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web |last=Hansen |first=Stig Jarle |author-link=Stig Jarle Hansen |date=2016-10-17 |title=Has Shabaab been weakened for good?

=== Propaganda films ===
Al-Shabaab began creating [[propaganda film]]s early in its campaign against Ethiopian forces,{{sfn|Grobbelaar|2022}} produced by its dedicated media wing, [[al-Kataib Media Foundation]].{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}} 

Since 2009, al-Shabaab's films have become noticeably more "professional", both in their production quality and in their messaging, reportedly with direct support from al-Qaeda's as-Sahab Media Foundation.{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}} The early films were distributed primarily, and widely, online, and were primarily used as tools for recruitment, particularly among foreign jihadists.{{sfn|Grobbelaar|2022}} More recent films show al-Shabaab distributing humanitarian aid and participating in other community or religious activities – though others are much more gruesome, displaying the corpses of beheaded members alleged to have been spies.<ref name="media" />{{sfn|Chonka|2016a}} Propaganda films are also occasionally used to attempt to mobilise jihadi activity abroad: in October 2013, one film encouraged British jihadists to follow the example set by [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby's killers]],<ref name="aljazeera">{{cite web |author=Hooper |first=Simon |date=2013-10-26 |title=British Muslims defiant over al-Shabab threat |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/british-muslims-defiant-over-al-shabab-threat-2013102591313719196.html |access-date=2013-11-06 |website=Al Jazeera |publisher= |archive-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031172927/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/british-muslims-defiant-over-al-shabab-threat-2013102591313719196.html |url-status=live }}</ref> while a February 2015 film called (without effect) for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, including the [[West Edmonton Mall]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, and the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].<ref name="Nittwemvrs">{{cite news |date=22 February 2015 |title=No "imminent threat" to West Edmonton Mall visitors, RCMP says |work=Edmonton Journal |agency= |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/Terror+group+Shabaab+calls+attack+West+Edmonton+Mall/10833693/story.html |url-status=dead |access-date=22 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224194018/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Terror%2Bgroup%2BShabaab%2Bcalls%2Battack%2BWest%2BEdmonton%2BMall/10833693/story.html |archive-date=February 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=22 February 2015 |title='Be particularly careful' today, U.S. homeland security chief tells MOA visitors |work=Star Tribune |agency= |url=http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=293319551 |access-date=22 February 2015 |archive-date=September 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930165649/http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=293319551 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Internet and social media ===
Al-Shabaab was an early adopter among African insurgents of the [[Internet]], which it uses to distribute its propaganda videos and for various other propaganda functions.{{sfn|Grobbelaar|2022}} Especially in its early years, it used online chatrooms and discussion forums, encouraging foreign fighters and even military commanders to post updates and field public questions about the state of the jihad.{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}} Particularly prominent was American-born Omar Shafik Hammami, also known as [[Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki]], who for many years kept a [[Vlog|video blog]] about his life in al-Shabaab and who, from 2009, also created and posted [[Rapping|raps]] about jihad.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gartenstein-Ross |first=Daveed |title=Bin Laden's Legacy: Why We're Still Losing the War on Terror |publisher=Wiley |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-118-09494-5 |location=Hoboken, NJ |page=149}}</ref>{{sfn|Mair|2017}} Al-Shabaab also had an official website, which carried official statements and news – including sundry edicts and threats – and religious guidance. Since the site was closed in 2009, it has distributed its press releases and videos using other sympathetic websites, or, more commonly, using [[social media]] networks.{{sfn|Grobbelaar|2022}}{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}}

Indeed, although al-Shabaab spokesmen occasionally grant interviews to "carefully selected" local and foreign journalists,{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}} social media networks have provided an important channel for interaction with the press, as well as for disseminating information and building support. Al-Shabaab has used [[Facebook]], particularly to communicate with the [[Somali diaspora]];{{sfn|Menkhaus|2014}} and it has made prolific and innovative use of [[Twitter]] since late 2011,<ref name=":28">{{Cite web |last=Mohamed |first=Hamza |date=2013-12-16 |title=Al-Shabab say they are back on Twitter |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/12/16/al-shabab-say-they-are-back-on-twitter |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en |archive-date=September 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220910165517/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/12/16/al-shabab-say-they-are-back-on-twitter |url-status=live }}</ref> although its first accounts were active as early as 2009.{{Sfn|Molony|2019}} Online engagement with al-Shabaab surged during Operation Linda Nchi, the Kenyan offensive of 2011–12, when al-Shabaab used Twitter, under the handle @HSMPress, to urge Somalis to take up arms against the Kenyan forces<ref name="Aljazeera">{{cite news |date=October 17, 2011 |title=Al-Shabaab threatens to attack Kenya |work=Al Jazeera |publisher= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111017171543493140.html |access-date=October 17, 2011 |archive-date=October 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018005440/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111017171543493140.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and to portray its own military losses as tactical retreats.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oloya |first=Opiyo |date=August 16, 2011 |title=Uganda: Al-Shabaab Progpaganda Can't Change the Truth On the Ground |newspaper=allAfrica.com |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201108170891.html |access-date=November 20, 2011}}</ref> In an extreme example of the latter in late 2011, al-Shabaab photos purportedly showed several dozen AMISOM casualties – but, according to an [[African Union]] spokesperson, in fact showed al-Shabaab's own casualties dressed in their adversaries' uniforms.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Guled |first1=Abdi |last2=Houreld |first2=Katharine |date=2011-10-21 |title=AU: Somali militants 'dressed up' bodies for stunt |work=Boston.com |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2011/10/21/au_10_soldiers_killed_2_missing_in_somalia_fight/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |archive-date=September 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220910165515/http://archive.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2011/10/21/au_10_soldiers_killed_2_missing_in_somalia_fight/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=October 22, 2011 |title=Kenya: A Weakening Al Shabaab Escalates Its Propaganda |newspaper=allAfrica |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201110240870.html |access-date=November 20, 2011}}</ref> What received most attention, however, were tweets al-Shabaab posted mocking the [[Kenya Defence Forces]] (KDF) and sparring with Major Emmanuel Chirchir, then the KDF's official spokesman.{{Sfn|Molony|2019}}<ref name="NYT HSMPress story">{{cite news |last=Gettleman |first=Jeffrey |date=December 15, 2011 |title=Somalia's Insurgents Embrace Twitter as a Weapon |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/world/africa/somalias-rebels-embrace-twitter-as-a-weapon.html |access-date=December 24, 2011 |archive-date=December 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224060459/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/world/africa/somalias-rebels-embrace-twitter-as-a-weapon.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Responding to Chirchir's claim that Kismayo had been captured by the KDF, al-Shabaab tweeted that the KDF "boys are a grotesque parody of an army!

In territories it holds, al-Shabaab typically maintains "limited but effective" administrative control over resident populations,{{Sfn|International Crisis Group|2022}} providing services – such as [[dispute resolution]] through Sharia-based courts – which are sometimes compared favourably to those offered in government-held territories.{{Sfn|Barnett|2020}}{{sfn|Skjelderup|2020}} Somalis have been observed to travel out of government-controlled areas into Al-Shabaab territory to settle disputes, particularly involving clan dynamics, lacking trust in official institutions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-27 |title=No Justice, No Peace: Al-Shabaab's Court System |url=https://hir.harvard.edu/no-justice-no-peace-al-shabaabs-court-system/ |access-date=2024-10-04 |website=Harvard International Review |language=en}}</ref> Al-Shabaab claimed some credit for Somalia's excellent [[crop yield]] in early 2010, saying that [[Agriculture in Somalia|Somali grain production]] had flourished due to al-Shabaab's reduction of food imports, and that the policy had [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributed income]] to poor, rural Somali farmers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-03-24 |title=Shabab credit for Somali food boom |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/3/24/shabab-credit-for-somali-food-boom |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en |archive-date=September 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220911121145/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/3/24/shabab-credit-for-somali-food-boom |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the group has also allegedly committed widespread [[human rights]] abuses against populations in its territories, including through a brutal interpretation and application of Islamic jurisprudence on [[hudud]].{{sfn|Skjelderup|2014}}{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2010}}

=== Humanitarian access ===
Despite routinely expelling, attacking, and harassing aid workers, al-Shabaab permits some agencies to work in areas under its control. At the height of its territorial control it implemented a system of aid agency regulation, taxation and surveillance. Where agencies are allowed to operate, this is often due to the desire of al-Shabaab to coopt and materially and politically benefit from the provision of aid and services.{{Sfn|Jackson|Aynte|2013}} Senior aid agency representatives often strongly rejected claims that they talked with al-Shabaab, while aid workers working in al-Shabaab-controlled areas often reported they directly negotiated with the group out of necessity.{{Sfn|Jackson|2014}} Complaints made against the group include its attacks on aid workers. According to journalist [[Jon Lee Anderson]]:<blockquote>The number of people in Somalia who are dependent on international food aid has tripled since 2007, to an estimated 3.6 million.

In general, foreign activity in al-Shabaab has decreased, first, and perhaps most importantly, because the [[Syrian civil war]] became [[Foreign fighters in the Syrian civil war|the focal point]] for foreign jihadist recruitment networks.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019a}} Other factors, however, are more specific to al-Shabaab. One factor was the group's internal struggle of 2011–2013: as tensions between Somali and non-Somali members increased, Godane scapegoated the foreigners as the cause of the group's disunity and, during his 2013 purge, executed various foreign recruits {{See above|[[#Drought, al-Qaeda, and internal struggle|above]]}}.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019a}}{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}} In addition to serving as a disincentive to foreign fighters, this shift reduced the influence of the group's remaining foreign leaders.{{sfn|Bryden|2014}} Moreover, whereas the ascendancy of Godane and his faction had partly internationalized al-Shabaab, in subsequent years, al-Shabaab became (re-)"domesticated": as it made territorial gains, its attention was increasingly consumed by local governance and the management of clan dynamics, activities in which foreign fighters – frequently mistrusted by local populations – lacked utility and influence.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}} As the conflict, and al-Shabaab's priorities, became more localized and clan-based, they also held less appeal for foreign fighters themselves.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019a}} Foreign fighters also attracted the counterterrorism efforts of foreign countries, and were sometimes suspected of disloyalty and spying by their Somali peers.{{Sfn|Bacon|Muibu|2019b}}

=== Affiliates in Kenya ===
Al-Shabaab has  Kenya-based affiliates, with [[Al-Hijra]] as its official Kenyan wing from 2012, then with a unit established in 2013 known as [[Jaysh Ayman]], based primarily in the Boni Forest. While the former group was used to carry out minor attacks within Kenya, the Al-Shabaab leadership later switched its focus to Jaysh Ayman which proved more effective. Jaysh Ayman comprises both Somali and Kenyan fighters as well as fighters from overseas.

=== Al-Qaeda ===
Before 2012, al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab had what academic [[Daniel Byman]] calls an "on-again, off-again" relationship, though both groups praised each other online in 2008.{{Sfn|Byman|2012}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aynte |first=Abdi |date=2012-03-19 |title=Understanding the al-Shabaab/al-Qaeda 'merger' |url=https://africanarguments.org/2012/03/understanding-the-al-shabaabal-qaeda-merger-by-abdi-aynte/ |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=African Arguments |language=en-GB |archive-date=September 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220901041906/https://africanarguments.org/2012/03/understanding-the-al-shabaabal-qaeda-merger-by-abdi-aynte/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During this early period, al-Shabaab occasionally harboured al-Qaeda leaders in Somalia, in exchange for their technical assistance.{{Sfn|Byman|2012}}<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |last=Kahan |first=Adam |date=2011-08-09 |title=Al Shabaab's Rise in the al Qaeda Network |url=https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/al-shabaabs-rise-in-the-al-qaeda-network |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=Critical Threats |archive-date=September 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220910141505/https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/al-shabaabs-rise-in-the-al-qaeda-network |url-status=live }}</ref> In September 2009, in a video entitled "At Your Service Osama", al-Shabaab publicly declared allegiance to al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]] – but this reflected an "unrequited courtship", largely ignored by al-Qaeda.{{Sfn|Lahoud|2012}} However, after bin Laden's death and replacement by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], al-Shabaab became an official al-Qaeda affiliate in February 2012.

=== Islamic State ===
In early 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) published online the first of a series of videos aimed at al-Shabaab, calling on the group to switch allegiances from al-Qaeda to ISIL and its leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Meleagrou-Hitchens |first1=Alexander |date=September 3, 2019 |title=ISIS and al Qaeda Struggle for al Shabab's Soul |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/kenya/2015-10-08/terrorist-tug-war |magazine=Foreign Affairs |url-access=subscription |access-date=December 7, 2015 |archive-date=December 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211013454/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/kenya/2015-10-08/terrorist-tug-war |url-status=live }}</ref> These public appeals had reportedly been preceded by informal ISIL attempts to establish a relationship with al-Shabaab.{{sfn|Warner|Weiss|2017}} Yet al-Shabaab publicly ignored the overtures.{{sfn|Warner|Weiss|2017}} By September 2015, it had issued an internal memo, directed at pro-ISIL elements in its ranks, reaffirming the group's allegiance to al-Qaeda and banning any discussion about ISIL.

=== Internal revenue ===
==== Trade and smuggling ====
[[File:Kismayo, Somalia.jpg|thumb|The port city of [[Kismayo]], held by al-Shabaab between 2009 and 2012, is a [[charcoal]] smuggling hub. ]]As al-Shabaab expanded its territorial control, it was able to augment its internal funding through illicit markets and local populations. The smuggling of [[charcoal]] has been an important source of income for the group since it first gained control of Somali port cities, especially Kismayo.{{sfn|Petrich|2022}} Calculating that al-Shabaab was earning between $15 million and $50 million annually from illegal trade, the UN banned Somali charcoal imports.{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}} The group also profits from involvement in – or taxation of – the smuggling and sale of [[ivory]], sugar, and, reportedly, [[heroin]];{{Sfn|Dathan|2017}}{{sfn|Petrich|2022}} and it has been implicated in [[illegal mining]] and minerals exports in East Africa.{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}} There is some evidence that al-Shabaab has profited from [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|piracy]]. In 2011, the head of the UN's counter-piracy division, Colonel John Steed, warned that there was circumstantial evidence that al-Shabaab increasingly sought to cooperate with [[Piracy in Somalia|pirate gangs]] and other criminal organizations.<ref name="pirate links">{{cite news |date=October 20, 2011 |title=Shabaab-Somali pirate links growing: UN adviser |work=Reuters |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79J0G620111020?sp=true |url-status=dead |access-date=February 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223205734/http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79J0G620111020?sp=true |archive-date=December 23, 2011}}</ref> Further reports suggested that Al-Shabaab members had extorted pirates, demanding [[Protection racket|protection money]] equivalent to 20% of the pirates' [[ransom]] proceeds, but did not provide evidence that al-Shabaab was itself involved in piracy.<ref name="Prceuwsm">{{cite news |last=Lough |first=Richard |date=July 6, 2011 |title=Piracy ransom cash ends up with Somali militants |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/somalia-piracy-idUSLDE7650U320110706 |access-date=February 12, 2012 |archive-date=December 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219172447/http://www.reuters.com/article/somalia-piracy-idUSLDE7650U320110706 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Extortion and taxation ====
Also in the 2008–2011 period, al-Shabaab established a sophisticated taxation system, framed as a form of [[zakat]], in line with sharia, but often resembling extortion. Al-Shabaab taxes may apply to clans, traders, corporations, farmers, or [[livestock]] herders – in fact, livestock are sometimes stolen outright by al-Shabaab militants, with the theft framed as a kind of pre-emptive [[In kind|in-kind]] taxation.{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}} Humanitarian aid agencies are also taxed or extorted, in exchange for permission to operate inside certain territories {{See below|{{section link|#Humanitarian access}}}};{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}} and al-Shabaab has been known to execute [[kidnapping]]s for ransom.{{Sfn|Felter|Masters|Sergie|2020}} In recent years, facing territorial losses in urban areas, al-Shabaab has had less recourse to previous revenue streams – notably the charcoal trade, through Kismayo, and the remittance economy – and therefore has relied more heavily on extracting zakat.{{sfn|Chonka|2016b}} The development of its security and intelligence services has allowed it to expand its tax base by imposing taxes even in areas outside its territorial control:{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}} according to the Hiraal Institute, more than half of al-Shabaab's revenue in 2019–20 came from Mogadishu, whose major companies are taxed at 2.5% of their annual profits.<ref name=":17" /> Indeed, a commander in the Somali army confessed to paying tax to al-Shabaab despite being at war with it.<ref name=":17" /> The group has been known to punish non-payment severely, including by [[Blockade|blockading]] villages under threat of starvation.{{sfn|Levy|Yusuf|2021}}

==== Somali government ====
Either directly or indirectly through black markets, al-Shabaab has access to arms intended for the Somali government. In 2018 and 2019, expert reports to the UN Security Council found that government military equipment enters the [[Arms trafficking|black market]], where some of it is sold to al-Shabaab militants. In some cases, senior government officials orchestrate large-scale diversions of government arms and ammunition; in others, low-ranking members of the security forces sell their weapons for subsistence.{{Sfn|United Nations|2019}}{{Sfn|United Nations|2018}} An earlier report in 2014 had alleged that government officials were actively involved in the direct supply of governments arms to al-Shabaab.<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 14, 2014 |title=Somalia diverting arms to al-Shabab, UN report claims |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26200015 |access-date=April 12, 2020 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308195349/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26200015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The group has also been known to infiltrate government institutions, as became clear when regional government employees carried out al-Shabaab's [[24 July 2019 Mogadishu bombing]], which killed Mogadishu Mayor [[Abdirahman Omar Osman|Abdirahmean Omar Osman]].{{Sfn|United Nations|2019}}
