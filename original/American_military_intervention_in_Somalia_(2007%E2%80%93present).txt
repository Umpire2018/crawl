Since the early 2000s, the [[United States]] has provided military support to the [[Transitional Federal Government of Somalia|Transitional Federal Government]] and the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] in conflicts. U.S. military actions in Somalia date back to the 1990s; however, following the [[September 11th attacks]], military action was justified as [[counterterrorism]]. The [[Obama administration|Obama]] and [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]s conducted drone and fighter aircraft strikes, advisory missions, and training; provided intelligence; and attacked [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] militants. Two U.S. special operations personnel, two contractors, one US Army soldier, and a CIA paramilitary officer have died during operations in [[Somalia]].

Robert Moore, a public policy advisor, has outlined various justifications for US intervention in Somalia, including the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001|2001 AUMF]] which authorizes the President to use force against the perpetrators of the September 11th attacks and their allies (al-Shabbab declared an alliance with [[al-Qaeda]] in 2012). Additionally, proponents argue for military intervention for humanitarian purposes, citing the [[Responsibility to protect|Responsibility to Protect]] doctrine, suggesting that international intervention could have prevented the [[Rwandan genocide|Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994. Moore, however, critiques these justifications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MOORE |first1=ROBERT |title=End the American military presence in Somalia |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/522069-end-the-american-military-presence-in-somalia?rl=1 |website=the Hill|date=21 October 2020 }}</ref>

In late 2020, President [[Donald Trump]] announced the withdrawal of most US troops from Somalia by 15 January 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 December 2020|title=Trump orders withdrawal of US troops from Somalia|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55196130|website=BBC|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The Department of Defense confirmed the completion of troop withdrawal on 17 January 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 January 2021|title=US military says its troop removal from Somalia is complete|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/us-military-troop-removal-somalia-complete-75309463|website=ABC|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> Despite this, the US has continued training allied forces, conducting limited airstrikes, and special operations.

In May 2022, President [[Joe Biden]] accepted a Department of Defense request to redeploy US soldiers to Somalia to combat [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] insurgents, as reported by a government spokesman.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Savage |first1=Charlie |last2=Schmitt |first2=Eric |date=2022-05-16 |title=Biden Approves Plan to Redeploy Several Hundred Ground Forces Into Somalia |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/us/politics/biden-military-somalia.html |access-date=2022-05-17 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Background==
Since 2007, the [[Department of Defense (United States)]] has targeted Islamist groups, mainly [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], within Somalia using [[airstrike]]s. These have included targeted [[drone strikes]] and [[United States Navy]] missile strikes. Special forces teams have conducted raids and acted as advisors.

=== Ethiopian invasion of Somalia (2006) ===
{{Main|War in Somalia (2006–2009)|l1 = Ethiopian invasion}}
The rise of the [[Islamic Courts Union]] during the early 2000s, along with the growing [[Insurgency in Ogaden|insurgency in the Ogaden]] waged by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]], raised Ethiopian concerns of an eventual renewed drive for Somali unification. A strong Somali state not dependent on [[Addis Ababa]] was perceived as a security threat,<ref name="Cocodia-2021">{{Cite journal |last=Cocodia |first=Jude |date=2021-04-03 |title=Rejecting African Solutions to African Problems: The African Union and the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19392206.2021.1922026 |journal=African Security |language=en |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=110–131 |doi=10.1080/19392206.2021.1922026 |issn=1939-2206 |s2cid=236350899 |quote=Ethiopia considered a weak Somali state dependent on Ethiopian support as a lesser threat than a strong one.

[[Channel 4]] acquired a leaked document detailing a confidential meeting between senior American and Ethiopian officials in [[Addis Ababa]] six months prior to the full scale December 2006 invasion. Participants deliberated on various scenarios, with the 'worst-case scenario' being the potential takeover of Somalia by the [[Islamic Courts Union]]. The documents revealed that the US found the prospect unacceptable and would back Ethiopia in the event of an ICU takeover. Journalist [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] reported that during the meeting ‘the blueprint for a very American supported Ethiopian invasion of Somalia was hatched’. No Somali officials were involved in the discussions.<ref name="Khayre-2014">{{Cite journal |last=Khayre |first=Ahmed Ali M. |date=2014 |title=Self-defence, Intervention by Invitation, or Proxy War?
