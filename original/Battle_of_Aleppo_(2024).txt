On 29 November 2024, [[Syrian opposition]] group [[Tahrir al-Sham]], along with allied [[Turkey|Turkish]]-backed groups in the [[Military Operations Command (Syria)|Military Operations Command]], entered the [[Ba'athist Syria|Syrian government]]-held city of [[Aleppo]]. The battle began on the third day of a [[Northwestern Syria offensive (2024)|large-scale rebel offensive]]. It was the first time fighting had broken out in the city since the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)|earlier battle]], which began in 2012 and ended in 2016 when the Assad administration pushed rebels out of the city.

On 30 November 2024, opposition groups captured most of the city amidst the collapse of pro-government forces. Coinciding with the lightning-speed takeover of Aleppo, the rebels pushed into the countryside of northern [[Hama]]; the whole city of Hama eventually [[2024 Hama offensive|fell to the rebels]] on December 5.

== Background ==
{{main|2024 Syrian opposition offensives}}
After the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)|battle from 2012 to 2016]], Syrian government forces did not develop or increase the military defenses of the city even though rebel forces continued to operate to Aleppo's west. Instead, the pro-government groups engaged in [[Corruption in Syria|corruption]], and were thus not well prepared for major insurgent attacks.<ref name="ICG" />

On 27 November 2024, Syrian opposition groups led by Tahrir al-Sham launched an offensive against pro-government forces in Northwestern Syria. The offensive, the first of its kind by any side in the conflict since [[Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019–March 2020)|March 2020 Idlib ceasefire]], resulted in the rapid capture of dozens of villages by the opposition forces. During the offensive, rebels reportedly seized 70 sites in the provinces of [[Aleppo]] and [[Idlib]] and about 10,000 civilians fled the fighting to the Idlib countryside, northwestern Syria.<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 November 2024 |title=Syria insurgents breach second largest city of Aleppo, fighters and war monitor say|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-insurgents-breach-second-largest-city-of-aleppo-fighters-and-war-monitor-say-/7881390.html |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=Voice of America}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Armed groups opposed to Assad's regime in Syria enter Aleppo city center |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/armed-groups-opposed-to-assads-regime-in-syria-enter-aleppo-city-center/3408670 |access-date=29 November 2024 |website=Anadolu Agency |archive-date=29 November 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241129192209/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/armed-groups-opposed-to-assads-regime-in-syria-enter-aleppo-city-center/3408670 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{bsn|date=December 2024}}

One Syrian Army [[colonel]] later argued that the Aleppo-based troops had previously relied on [[Hezbollah]] and Iranian officers for operational command, but these had been largely withdrawn from Syria at the time of the opposition offensive. Among the remaining Aleppo-based garrison were Iraqi militias and some Iranian advisers.<ref name="collapsed" /> On 28 November, a meeting of high-ranking officers in Aleppo was successfully attacked by the rebels.

The Kurdish [[enclave]] inside the city, namely the neighbourhoods of [[Sheikh Maqsoud]] and Ashrafieh, were besieged by the rebels, with the approximately 100,000 residents facing "dwindling food supplies and a lack of services".

It was also reportedly preparing to counter-attack, while rebel gatherings within the city were targed by airstrikes.<ref name="dozens"/>
* {{Flag|Turkey}}: Foreign minister [[Hakan Fidan]] reiterated that Turkey is not involved in the ongoing conflicts in Aleppo.
