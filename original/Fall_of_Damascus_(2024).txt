==Background==
{{main|2024 Syrian opposition offensives|Syrian civil war}}

By late 2018, Syrian opposition rebel groups were forced into [[Idlib Governorate]], the last rebel-held governorate of Syria after seven years of fighting against the [[Assad regime]] and [[Syrian Army]] during the [[Syrian civil war]], after the SAA captured the city of [[Aleppo]] and conducted peace deals with rebel groups in the southern [[Daraa Governorate]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Khadder |first=Kareem |date=2018-07-06 |title=Russia, rebels reach interim ceasefire agreement in Syrian south |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/06/middleeast/agreement-daraa-syria-intl/index.html |access-date=2024-12-12 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Idlib: The Last Major Battle in the Syrian Civil War |url=https://www.usip.org/blog/2018/09/idlib-last-major-battle-syrian-civil-war |access-date=2024-12-12 |website=United States Institute of Peace |language=en}}{{dead link|date=April 2025|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Several rebel groups were present in Idlib, including the [[Islamist]] rebel group [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (which broke away from the [[Al-Nusra Front]]), the Turkish-backed [[Syrian National Army]], and dozens of smaller nationalist and Islamist opposition groups which largely operate in a shared command with larger groups.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2018-09-07 |title=Syria: Who's in control of Idlib? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45401474 |access-date=2024-12-12 |language=en-GB}}</ref> In Southern Syria, the opposition consisted mostly of demobilised fighters who had undergone reconciliation through previous cease-fire agreements and subsequently conducted local insurrections as Government forces withdrew in early December. An additional American-backed [[Syrian Free Army]] opposition force controlled a section of desert around the post of [[al-Tanf]].{{cn|date=February 2025}}

Between the end of the ceasefire and the start of the [[2024 Syrian opposition offensives]] HTS leader [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] sought peace deals with the other rebel coalitions, and hunted down Hurras al-Din and Islamic State fighters in rebel-held areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Palacios |first=Tammy Lynn |date=April 28, 2023 |title=Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's Top-Down Disassociation from al-Qaeda in Syria |url=https://jamestown.org/program/hayat-tahrir-al-shams-top-down-disassociation-from-al-qaeda-in-syria/ |access-date=2024-12-12 |website=The Jamestown Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref> Jolani also built institutions to digitize the rebel-held area, such as improving tax collecting, street cleaning, and food distribution, while preaching a message of unity to [[Syrian Christian]]s and [[Shia]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zelin |first=Aaron Y. |date=December 3, 2024 |title=How Syria's 'Diversity-Friendly' Jihadists Plan on Building a State |url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/how-syrias-diversity-friendly-jihadists-plan-building-state |access-date=2024-12-12 |website=The Washington Institute |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cohen |first=Michael A. |date=2024-12-09 |title=How Syria's Bashar al-Assad fell so quickly — and what the U.S. should do next |url=https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/syrias-assad-hts-russia-iran-united-states-rcna183478 |access-date=2024-12-12 |website=MSNBC |language=en}}</ref>

==Prelude==
In November 2024, a coalition of rebel groups spearheaded by HTS [[Battle of Aleppo (2024)|attacked Aleppo]], quickly overrunning the demotivated and disorganized defenders. In response, Assad travelled to Russia to ask for military aid on 28 November; his request was denied. Upon returning home, however, he lied to his senior commanders and advisors, claiming that Russia would soon send aid.<ref name="reuters">{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/assads-final-hours-syria-deception-despair-flight-2024-12-13/| title = Assad's final hours in Syria: Deception, despair and flight| author1 =Samia Nakhoul | author2 =Maya Gebeily | author3 =Parisa Hafezi | author4 =Suleiman Al-Khalidi| website = Reuters| date = 13 December 2024| access-date = 14 December 2024}}</ref> His wife [[Asma al-Assad|Asma]] had already been in [[Moscow]] for [[cancer treatment]] for months, accompanied by their children.<ref name="wp">{{cite news |title=How Syria's rebels overcame years of a bloody stalemate to topple Assad |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/21/syria-rebels-assad-iran-turkey/?isMobile=1 |author1=Kareem Fahim |author2=Loveday Morris |author3=Louisa Loveluck |author4=Greg Miller |author5=Mohamad El Chamaa |author6=Beril Eski |newspaper=Washington Post |date=21 December 2024 |access-date=21 December 2024}}</ref><ref name="france24">{{cite news |title=A palace in shock: Bashar al-Assad's final moments in Syria |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241214-a-palace-in-shock-bashar-al-assad-s-final-moments-in-syria |agency=AFP |publisher=France24 |date=14 December 2024 |access-date=21 December 2024}}</ref> A few days later, the rebels captured Aleppo. Afterward, reports emerged of a coup led by Syrian State Security Director General [[Hossam Louka]] against the Assad government. The Syrian Army General Command as well as the Iranian ambassador to Syria, [[Hossein Akbari]], both denied these reports.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-01 |title=Iranian ambassador denies coup rumours in Damascus |url=https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-ambassador-denies-coup-rumours-in-damascus-355894/ |access-date=2024-12-31 |website=intellinews |language=en}}</ref> On 2 December, Assad met with [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Iranian Foreign Minister]] [[Abbas Araghchi]] to discuss the situation. He confided that the Syrian Armed Forces were too weak to offer effective resistance to the continuing rebel advance. Regardless, he did not request increased Iranian aid, probably due to concerns about an Israeli intervention. At this point, the Syrian President had possibly concluded that the war was already lost. Despite this, he continued to tell his inner circle that Russian support would be coming, imploring them to continue their work.<ref name="reuters" />

After the [[2024 Hama offensive|fall of Hama]] on 5 December, the government began redeploying its troops from Eastern [[Ghouta]], including [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] and [[Harasta]], to the entrances and exits of Damascus.<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 December 2024 |title=Hope and suspense in East Ghouta as the regime loses ground |url=https://syriadirect.org/hope-and-suspense-in-east-ghouta-as-the-regime-loses-ground/ |publisher=[[Syria Direct]]}}</ref> However, witnesses stated that efforts to organize a proper defense quickly derailed as most officers and soldiers refused to continue resistance or outright fled. There were contradictory orders to soldiers and policemen, with commanders initially ordering them to stay at their positions or to retreat or vice versa.

Eventually, the 4th Division commander discovered that the chief of the general staff had ordered a general retreat from the capital, whereupon he attempted to countermand the order to little success.<ref name="wp" />
