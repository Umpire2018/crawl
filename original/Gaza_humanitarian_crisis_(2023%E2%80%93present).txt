This report builds on a foundation of previous Costs of War research for its framework and methodology in covering the most significant chains of impact, or causal pathways, to indirect war deaths in Gaza and the West Bank.

In his address to the UN Security Council on 31 January 2024, Martin Griffiths, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordination, provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges currently confronting numerous individuals in Gaza. According to our latest estimates, approximately 75 percent of the entire population has been displaced. The living conditions they endure are deplorable and deteriorating with each passing day. The makeshift tent camps, established by refugees and displaced people, are being inundated by heavy rains, compelling children, parents, and the elderly to seek shelter in the mud. The issue of food insecurity continues to escalate, while access to clean water remains almost entirely unattainable. Given the limited availability of public health support, preventable diseases are rampant and will persistently propagate.<ref name="Humanitarian impact of the conflict"/> On 4 March, the Gaza Health Ministry stated they had recorded about one million cases of infectious diseases.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Usaid |last1=Siddiqui |first2=Maziar |last2=Motamedi |date=4 March 2024 |title=Gaza Health Ministry: We detected about one million cases of infectious diseases |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/3/4/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-repeats-attacks-as-children-die-of-hunger?update=2747606 |work=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |access-date=6 March 2024 |archive-date=4 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240304192046/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/3/4/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-repeats-attacks-as-children-die-of-hunger?update=2747606 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The situation in Gaza is worsening, leading to the spread of diseases due to the lack of clean water and insufficient sewage facilities. According to the United Nations, the people in Gaza are facing a shortage of water and hygiene materials, which is negatively impacting their overall well-being and physical health. Additionally, the accumulation of solid waste in public areas, hospitals, IDP shelters, and other locations is a major concern as it poses significant risks to public health. The uncollected waste, amounting to tens of thousands of tons, is exacerbating these risks.<ref name="Humanitarian impact of the conflict"/> In April 2024, the Gaza Media Office stated environmental contamination in northern Gaza had reached "unprecedented levels" due to "mountains of waste and hundreds of mass graves".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Nils |last1=Adler |first2=Farah |last2=Najjar |date=15 April 2024 |title=Northern Gaza faces 'unprecedented levels' of contamination, media office says |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/4/15/israels-war-on-gaza-live-five-killed-in-nuseirat-as-israel-strikes-camps?update=2838858 |work=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |access-date=17 April 2024 |archive-date=17 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417035546/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/4/15/israels-war-on-gaza-live-five-killed-in-nuseirat-as-israel-strikes-camps?update=2838858 |url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2024, the UN stated, "Mosquitoes, flies and rats are spreading, and so are diseases."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Maziar |last1=Motamedi |first2=Usaid |last2=Siddiqui |date=5 May 2024 |title=UN sounds alarms on 'sanitation crisis' in war-stricken Gaza |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/5/5/israels-war-on-gaza-live-neither-side-willing-to-budge-in-truce-talks?update=2880934 |work=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |access-date=10 May 2024 |archive-date=10 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240510033627/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/5/5/israels-war-on-gaza-live-neither-side-willing-to-budge-in-truce-talks?update=2880934 |url-status=live}}</ref> Oxfam reported the threat of disease outbreaks due to an accumulation of "human waste and rivers of sewage in the streets".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shurafa |first1=Wafaa |title=Misery deepens in Gaza's Rafah as Israeli troops press operation |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/misery-deepens-gazas-rafah-israeli-troops-press-operation-110173165 |work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=20 May 2024 |archive-date=20 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240520002613/https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/misery-deepens-gazas-rafah-israeli-troops-press-operation-110173165 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Former Republican [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Michele Bachmann]] appearing in December in [[Charlie Kirk|The Charlie Kirk Show]] stated "So, it's time that Gaza ends. The two million people who live there – they are clever assassins. They need to be removed from that land. That land needs to be turned into a national park. And since they're the voluntary mercenaries for Iran, they need to be dropped on the doorstep of Iran. Let Iran deal with those people." She received a round of applause from the audience, while Kirk replied "I look at Israel and Israel says we never want another person into our country that doesn't share our values," Kirk said. "They said they don't want refugees. They don't want any of these people. I want American immigration policy to be like that."<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 December 2023 |title=Michele Bachmann Calls for Ethnic Cleansing in Gaza: 'They Need To Be Removed From That Land' |url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/michele-bachmann-calls-for-ethnic-cleansing-in-gaza-they-need-to-be-removed-from-that-land/ |access-date=19 December 2023 |website=[[Mediaite]] |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224135124/https://www.mediaite.com/tv/michele-bachmann-calls-for-ethnic-cleansing-in-gaza-they-need-to-be-removed-from-that-land/ |archive-date=24 December 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author=Media Matters Staff |date=18 December 2023 |title=Michelle Bachmann to Charlie Kirk: "It's time that Gaza ends.

In an interview with [[Fox News]] on March 5, 2024, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] stated that [[Joe Biden]] "dumped Israel" due to being overly influenced by pro-Palestinian protests, that "The Democrats are very bad for Israel," that he supports Israel’s ongoing offensive on Gaza in which Israel has to "finish the problem", and that the Biden administration "got soft", which commentators has viewed as a call to continue and "double down" on genocidal acts.

A group of eight [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Senators led by [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Jeff Merkley]], and [[Chris Van Hollen]] issued an official letter to President Joe Biden, calling on him to "enforce federal law" by requiring Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "to stop restricting humanitarian aid access to Gaza or forfeit U.S. military aid to Israel" as "The severe humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is nearly unprecedented in modern history" and "The United States should not provide military assistance to any country that interferes with U.S. humanitarian assistance." They cited the 1961 [[Foreign Assistance Act]], which states that "no assistance" shall be provided under that law or the [[Arms Export Control Act]] to any country that restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. "Stopping American humanitarian aid is in violation of the law. That should be clear. No more money to [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu's]] war machine to kill Palestinian children," Sanders said.<ref>{{bulleted list|
