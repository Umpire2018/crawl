'''Hirshabelle''', officially '''Hirshabelle State of Somalia''' ([[Somali language|Somali]]: ''Dowlad Goboleedka Hirshabelle ee [[Somalia|Soomaaliya]]''), is a [[States and regions of Somalia|Federal Member State]] in south-central [[Somalia]]. It is bordered by [[Galmudug]] state of Somalia to the north, [[South West State of Somalia]] and [[Banaadir|Banadir region]] to the south, [[Ethiopia]] to the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east. [[Jowhar]] is the capital state.

[[Hirshabelle]] consists of the [[Hiran, Somalia|Hiran]] and [[Middle Shabelle]] regions of Somalia. The name of the state originates from combining their names.
