Although the movement was initially limited to the goal of reforming [[Quota system of Bangladesh Civil Service|quotas in government jobs]], it snowballed into a mass anti-government uprising after the [[July massacre|mass killings against civilians]]. The movement was also fueled by ongoing socio-economic and political issues, including the government's mismanagement of the national economy, rampant corruption by government officials, human rights violations, allegations of undermining the country's sovereignty by Sheikh Hasina, and increasing [[Criticism of Awami League|authoritarianism]] and [[Democratic backsliding in Bangladesh|democratic backsliding]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lu |first=Christina |date=2024-08-07 |title=What's Behind Bangladesh's Student Protests? |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/18/bangladesh-student-protests-quota-system/ |access-date=2024-08-03 |website=Foreign Policy |language=en-US |archive-date=4 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240804023456/https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/18/bangladesh-student-protests-quota-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Ahmed |first1=Redwan |last2=Ellis-Petersen |first2=Hannah |date=2024-07-26 |title=Bangladesh student protests turn into 'mass movement against a dictator' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator |access-date=2024-08-03 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=4 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240804023457/https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sheikh Hasina doesn't sell the country, say prime minister |url=https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/76mu2u1gmz |access-date=5 August 2024 |work=[[Prothom Alo]] |date=25 June 2024 |language=en |archive-date=5 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240805130957/https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/76mu2u1gmz |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Background ==
{{Further|2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement|July massacre}}
[[File:July continues.jpg|thumb|People gathering at the Central Shahid Minar on 3 August, where the non-cooperation movement was declared]]
During the quota reform movement in 2024, participants—particularly students—faced resistance, mass arrests, and [[July massacre|massacre]] and severe injuries at the hands of [[Bangladesh Police|police]] and other [[security forces]]. Six coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement, who were leading the initial quota reform movement, were also detained and were forcefully made to announce the conclusion of the protests by the [[Detective Branch]] (DB) of the [[Dhaka Metropolitan Police]] (DMP). These events and [[authoritarianism]] fuelled people's anger against the government. On the morning of 3 August, one of the movement coordinators, [[Asif Mahmud]], stated in a [[Facebook]] post that they would start a "non-cooperation movement" against the government, saying that it would be similar to that of "[[Non-cooperation movement (1971)|March '71]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bengali/live/cgrlrjlj9drt?post=asset%3A42c956f7-9785-43f6-bfe7-41016b7562cd#asset:42c956f7-9785-43f6-bfe7-41016b7562cd|title=অসহযোগ আন্দোলন নিয়ে শিক্ষার্থীদের ১৫টি নির্দেশনা|language=bn|website=[[BBC Bangla]]|date=3 August 2024|access-date=3 August 2024|archive-date=3 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240803075022/https://www.bbc.com/bengali/live/cgrlrjlj9drt?post=asset:42c956f7-9785-43f6-bfe7-41016b7562cd#asset:42c956f7-9785-43f6-bfe7-41016b7562cd|url-status=live}}</ref> In the afternoon, Prime Minister Hasina proposed talks with the protesters, saying that "The doors of [[Ganabhaban]] (her official residence) are open".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-04 |title=18 killed, dozens injured as protestors and Awami League supporters clash in Bangladesh |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/18-killed-dozens-injured-as-protestors-and-awami-league-supporters-clash-in-bangladesh/3573428/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240805155112/https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/18-killed-dozens-injured-as-protestors-and-awami-league-supporters-clash-in-bangladesh/3573428/ |archive-date=5 August 2024 |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=[[The Financial Express (India)]] |language=en}}</ref>
