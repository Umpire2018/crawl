The '''Somali National Army''' ({{Langx|so|Ciidanka Xooga Dalka Soomaaliyeed|lit=Somali Ground Forces}}) are the ground forces component of the [[Somali Armed Forces]]. 

Since Somali independence in 1960, the Army fought to expand and increase Somalia's sphere of influence throughout the Horn of Africa counter to [[Derg|Ethiopia]]'s and [[Kenya]]'s ambitions, because of this, Somalia had amassed large ground forces. After the fall of [[Mohammad Siad Barre]] the Armed Forces began an unsteady rebirth in the 21st century.

== History ==
{{main|Somali Armed Forces#History}}
=== Origins ===
The Somali National Army can trace its roots back to troops used by the [[Ifat Sultanate]] as the successful [[Shewa|conquest of Shewa]] by the [[Ifat Sultanate]] ignited a rivalry for supremacy with the [[Solomonic dynasty]].

The [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]] established a national police force to defend the nascent Somali Republic's borders. A law to that effect was passed on 6 April 1960. Thus the [[Somali Police Force]]'s Mobile Group (Darawishta Poliska or Darawishta) was formed. 12 April 1960 has since been marked as ''Armed Forces Day''. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], and the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic.

Following independence, the SNA was created by merging police units in the former trusteeship with the northern [[Somaliland Scouts]] from the former British protectorate. Combined, both forces totalled around 1,800 to 2,000 men.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Colin D. |date=2019-10-02 |title=Glimpse into an army at its peak: notes on the Somali National Army in the 1960–80s |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14751798.2019.1675944 |journal=Defense & Security Analysis |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1080/14751798.2019.1675944 |s2cid=211441701 |issn=1475-1798}}</ref>

=== 1960s ===
Following its formation, the SNA was equipped with primarily British and Italian equipment from the two former Somalilands, dating from World War II. In 1962 it was noted that the SNA possessed a total of five tanks, all of which were [[Comet (tank)|Comet tanks]]. Other vehicles included six [[Ferret armoured car]] and eighteen [[Universal Carrier]]s.<ref name=":0" />

==== 1964 War ====
{{Main|1964 Ethiopian–Somali Border War}}
In February 1964, four years into its formation, the Somali National Army faced its first test during a short war with the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. The [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian Imperial Army]] was larger and better equipped than the SNA. The war was preceded and ignited by a [[1963 Ogaden Rebellion|rebellion and insurgency in the Ogaden region]], inhabited primarily by [[Somalis]], which began in mid-1963. The suppression of [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and [[reprisal]]s carried out by Emperor [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie's]] government resulted in a rapid decline in [[Ethiopia–Somalia relations|Ethio-Somali relations]]. Sporadic small-scale skirmishes between border police and Ethiopian airstrikes that began along the border in late 1963 escalated into large-scale warfare in early 1964. In mid-January 1964, border violence escalated and on 8 February both nations declared [[State of emergency|states of emergency]]. Regular army units from both militaries were deployed along the northern border, resulting in numerous large-scale military engagements in the [[Haud]], such as the Battle of [[Tog Wajaale]]. In the days following, the war spread across the entire 900-km [[Ethiopia–Somalia border|Ethiopian–Somali frontier]] with most combat taking place on the Somali side. The conflict was characterized by intense fighting around various [[Border checkpoint|border posts]] and villages, such as [[Dolow]], and [[Airstrike|aerial bombardments]] by the vastly superior [[Ethiopian Air Force]] on major urban centers in Somalia such as [[Hargeisa]] and [[Galkayo]]. The [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) attempted to broker several [[Ceasefire|ceasefire agreements]], but they repeatedly failed. Despite the continuing hostilities, both nations participated in [[Diplomacy|diplomatic negotiations]] in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], at the request of various African [[Head of state|heads of state]] and the war eventually concluded in early April 1964.{{sfn|Metz|1993|p=201}}

=== 1970s ===
Following the [[1969 Somali coup d'état]], the army assumed a central political role in the country. SNA officers of the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) ran the country's ministerial and administrative posts, while the rank and file of the army was involved more deeply in civic action programs such as [[sand dune stabilization]], road construction and refugee resettlement.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Ottaway |first=Marina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjhyAAAAMAAJ |title=Soviet and American Influence in the Horn of Africa |date=1982 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-03-058908-9 |pages=66–67 |language=en}}</ref>

By 1970, the Somali National Army was 10,000 men strong and possessed 150 tanks, most being Soviet [[T-34|T-34's]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ottaway |first=Marina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjhyAAAAMAAJ |title=Soviet and American Influence in the Horn of Africa |date=1982 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-03-058908-9 |pages=39 |language=en}}</ref> By 1975 this figure had risen to 250 tanks and 300 [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carriers]].<ref name=":1" />

Following the end of the [[Ogaden War]] and [[1978 Somali coup d'état attempt|coup attempt]] in 1978, the state of the SNA began to decline,<ref name=":0" />

Since 2019, Eritrea has been helping the reestablishment of the Somali National Army. That year it clandestinely accepted 5,000 recruits<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-30 |title=Eritrea instrumental in rebuilding of Somali army, says president |url=https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/eritrea-instrumental-in-rebuilding-of-somali-army-says-president |access-date=2024-09-14 |website=[[Garowe Online]] |language=en |quote=Eritrea first admitted 5,000 recruits in 2019}}</ref> in an operation overseen by NISA chief [[Fahad Yasin Haji Dahir|Fahad Yasin]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-30 |title=Why Eritrea delayed sending back Somali soldiers it trained? |url=https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/why-eritrea-delayed-sending-back-somali-soldiers-it-trained |access-date=2024-09-14 |website=[[Garowe Online]] |language=en}}</ref>
