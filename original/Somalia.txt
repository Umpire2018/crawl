==Etymology==
{{main|proto-Somali}}
[[Samaale]], the oldest common ancestor of several [[#clan|Somali clans]], is generally regarded as the source of the [[ethnonym]] ''Somali''. One other theory is that the name is held to be derived from the words ''soo'' and ''maal'', which together mean "go" and "milk". This interpretation differs depending on region with northern Somalis imply it refers to go and milk in regards to the camel's milk, southern Somalis use the transliteration "''sa''' ''maal''" which refers to cow's milk.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ali Jimale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdAzRYruCwC&q=northern+southern+soo+maal+invention&pg=PA85|title=The Invention of Somalia|date=1995|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-99-8|language=en}}</ref> This is a reference to the ubiquitous [[pastoralism]] of the Somali people.<ref>I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'', (Oxford University Press : 1963), p.12.</ref> Another plausible [[etymology]] proposes that the term ''Somali'' is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "wealthy" (''zāwamāl''), again referring to Somali riches in livestock.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.

Alternatively, the ethnonym ''Somali'' is believed to have been derived from the Automoli (Asmach), a group of warriors from [[ancient Egypt]] described by [[Herodotus]]. ''Asmach'' is thought to have been their Egyptian name, with ''Automoli'' being a Greek derivative of the Hebrew word ''S’mali'' (meaning "on the left hand side").<ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society, Issues 24–30|date=1926|publisher=The Society|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwccAAAAMAAJ|access-date=17 April 2018}}</ref>

A [[Tang dynasty|Tang Chinese]] document from the 9th century CE referred to the northern Somalia coast — which was then part of a broader region in [[Northeast Africa]] known as [[Barbara (region)|Barbaria]], in reference to the area's [[Barbara (region)|Barbars]] ([[Cushitic-speaking peoples|Cushitic]]) inhabitants<ref name="Laitin">David D.

LTD., 2002), p. 524.</ref>

The first clear written reference of the sobriquet ''Somali'' dates back to the early 15th century CE during the reign of Ethiopian Emperor [[Yeshaq I]] who had one of his court officials compose a [[hymn]] celebrating a military victory over the [[Sultanate of Ifat]].<ref>I.M. Lewis, ''A modern history of the Somali: nation and state in the Horn of Africa'', 4, illustrated edition, (James Currey: 2002), p.25.</ref> ''Simur'' was also an ancient [[Harari people|Harari]] alias for the Somali people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fage|first1=J.D|title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3|date=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&q=simur+harari&pg=PA154|access-date=10 March 2017|isbn=9780521209816}}</ref> 

Somalis overwhelmingly prefer the demonym ''Somali'' over the incorrect ''Somalian'' since the former is an endonym, while the latter is an exonym with double suffixes.<ref>Michel, A. D. A. M. "Panorama of Socio-Religious Communities1." Indian Africa: Minorities of Indian-Pakistani Origin in Eastern Africa (2015): 69.</ref> The [[hypernym]] of the term ''Somali'' from a geopolitical sense is ''[[Horner (demography)|Horner]]'' and from an ethnic sense, it is ''[[Cushitic peoples|Cushite]]''.<ref>Woldu, Demelash.

The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based on his stature and beauty, replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow: if the Persians could manage to draw it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire.<ref name="Wheeler pg 526" /><ref name="Kitto2">John Kitto, James Taylor, ''The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work'', (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p. 302.</ref> The Macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and [[gold]] wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains.<ref name="Kitto2" /> The [[camel]] is believed to have been domesticated in the Horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE.

During the classical period, the [[Barbaria (region)|Barbara]] city-states of [[Mosylon]], [[Opone]], [[Heis (town)|Mundus]], [[Bulhar|Isis]], [[Malao]], [[Zeila|Avalites]], [[Essina]], [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]] and [[Sarapion]] developed a lucrative trade network, connecting with merchants from [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], and the [[Roman Empire]]. They used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.
[[File:Beden.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Beden]] is a fast, ancient Somali single or double-masted maritime ship.]]
After the [[Nabatea#Roman annexation|Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire]] and the Roman naval presence at [[Aden]] to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants agreed with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=54}}.</ref> to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.<ref name="EHW">{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=229}}.</ref> However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.<ref>{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=187}}.</ref> For centuries, Indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to Somalia and Arabia from [[Ceylon]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]].

The dawn of [[fascism]] in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for Italy, as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of ''La Grande Somalia'' ("''[[Greater Somalia]]''") according to the plan of Fascist Italy. With the arrival of Governor [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] on 15 December 1923, things began to change for that part of Somaliland known as [[Italian Somaliland]].

A British force, including troops from several African countries, launched the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign in January 1941]] from Kenya to liberate British Somaliland and Italian-occupied Ethiopia and conquer Italian Somaliland. By February most of Italian Somaliland was captured and, in March, British Somaliland was retaken from the sea. The forces of the British Empire operating in Somaliland comprised the three divisions of South African, West African, and East African troops. They were assisted by Somali forces led by Abdulahi Hassan with Somalis of the [[Isaaq]], [[Dhulbahante]], and [[Warsangali]] clans prominently participating. The number of [[Italian Somalis]] began to decline after World War II, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999" />

Following World War II, Britain retained control of both [[British Somaliland]] and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland as the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]], on the condition first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL)—that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.<ref name="Zolberg">{{Harvnb|Zolberg|Suhrke|Aguayo|1989|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9_yS_ynvzgC&pg=PA106 106]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Kwame Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Africana: the encyclopedia of the African and African American experience: the concise desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cereWkyNJckC|date= 2003|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-1642-4|page=1749|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-date=23 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230123105443/https://books.google.com/books?id=cereWkyNJckC|url-status=live}}</ref> British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999">{{cite book|author=Paolo Tripodi|title=The Colonial Legacy in Somalia: Rome and Mogadishu: From Colonial Administration to Operation Restore Hope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJR3RAAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=978-0-312-22393-9|page=68|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-date=23 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230123105442/https://books.google.com/books?id=eJR3RAAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

To the extent that [[Italy]] held the territory by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in Western political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated in political administrative development. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulties integrating the two parts.<ref>[[Helen Chapin Metz]], ed.

A [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in neighbouring [[Djibouti]] (then known as [[French Somaliland]]) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France.

The revolutionary government established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural [[literacy]] campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate.

In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] in February, 1974.<ref>Benjamin Frankel (1992) ''The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World'', Gale Research, p. 306 {{ISBN|0-8103-8928-2}}.</ref> That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor of the [[African Union]] (AU).<ref>Oihe Yang (2000) ''Africa South of the Sahara 2001'', 30th ed., Taylor and Francis, p. 1025 {{ISBN|1-85743-078-6}}.</ref>

In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (SRSP), a one-party government based on [[scientific socialism]] and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|adapting Marxist precepts]] to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially [[Communism|communist]].<ref name="Pjdlfw" />

In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] broke out after Barre's government used a plea for national unity to justify an [[War of aggression|aggressive]] incorporation of the predominantly Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden]] region of Ethiopia into a Pan-Somali [[Greater Somalia]], along with the rich agricultural lands of south-eastern Ethiopia, infrastructure, and strategically important areas as far north as Djibouti.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gebru Tareke|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dRIfYPTZxJsC&pg=PA182 182–186]}}. The areas concerned amount to about a third of Ethiopia.</ref> In the first week of the conflict, Somali armed forces took southern and central Ogaden and for most of the war, the Somali army scored continuous victories on the Ethiopian army and followed them as far as [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. By September 1977, Somalia controlled 90% of the Ogaden and captured strategic cities such as [[Jijiga]] and put heavy pressure on [[Dire Dawa]], threatening the train route from the latter city to Djibouti. After the siege of Harar, a massive unprecedented Soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 [[Cuba]]n forces and several thousand Soviet experts came to the aid of Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] regime. By 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. This shift in support by the Soviet Union motivated the Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviets' [[Cold War]] arch-rival, the [[United States]], which had been courting the Somali government for some time. Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the United States enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.<ref name="Ramsbotham 222">{{cite book |author=Oliver Ramsbotham |author2=Tom Woodhouse |year=1999 |title=Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofin0000rams |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofin0000rams/page/222 222] |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0-87436-892-8}}</ref>[[File:Muhammad Siad Barre - 40866X9X9.jpg|thumb|Major General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], Chairman of the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]], meeting with President of Romania [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]]]A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held.

Many Somalis had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship.

The regime was weakened further in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by Ethiopia, sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the [[Somali Civil War]]. Among the militia groups were the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), [[United Somali Congress]] (USC), [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) and the [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the [[Somali Democratic Movement]] (SDM), the [[Factions in the Somali Civil War#Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA)|Somali Democratic Alliance]] (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).

As the [[moral authority]] of Barre's government was gradually eroded, many Somalis became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of [[Hargeisa]], a [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.<ref name="Locsg">{{cite web|title=Somalia&nbsp;— Government|url=http://countrystudies.us/somalia/65.htm|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=15 February 2014|archive-date=4 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704043353/http://countrystudies.us/somalia/65.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2013/10/22/state-sponsored-violence-and-conflict-under-mahamed-siyad-barre-the-emergence-of-path-dependent-patterns-of-violence/ |title=State-sponsored violence and conflict under Mahamed Siyad Barre: the emergence of path dependent patterns of violence |last1=Compagnon |first1=Daniel |date=22 October 2013 |publisher=[[World Peace Foundation]], [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] |access-date=7 October 2014 |archive-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002022805/https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2013/10/22/state-sponsored-violence-and-conflict-under-mahamed-siyad-barre-the-emergence-of-path-dependent-patterns-of-violence/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The clampdown initiated by [[Siad Barre|Barre]]'s government extended its reach beyond the initial bombings in the north to encompass various regions across the country. This reproduction of aggressive strategies aimed at stifling descent and retaining authority over the populace was a hallmark of the government's repressive actions in the South.

During 1990, in the capital city of Mogadishu, the residents were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four. Fuel shortages, inflation, and currency devaluation impacted the economy. A thriving black market existed in the centre of the city as banks experienced shortages of local currency for exchange. Harsh [[exchange control]] regulations were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency. Although no travel restrictions were placed on foreigners, photographing many locations was banned.

[[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]] opposed the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia and continued an insurgency against the TFG. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia.

Owing to a lack of funding and human resources, an [[arms embargo]] that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, Yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region's government. This left little revenue for Puntland's own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928150305/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archive-date=28 September 2013 |title=Somalia: Guide to Puntland Election 2009 |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=25 December 2008 |access-date=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |title=Opening Annual General Assembly Debate, Secretary-General Urges Member States to Press in Tackling Poverty, Terrorism, Human Rights Abuses, Conflicts |publisher=Unis.unvienna.org |access-date=12 June 2011 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727220517/http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Location===
[[File:Somalia (orthographic projection)2.png|thumb|Orthographic projection of Somalia]]
Somalia is bordered by Kenya to the southwest, the [[Gulf of Aden]] to the north, the [[Guardafui Channel]] and Indian Ocean to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. The country borders [[Djibouti]]. It lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel south|2°S]] and [[12th parallel north|12°N]], and longitudes [[41st meridian east|41°]] and [[52nd meridian east|52°E]]. Strategically located at the mouth of the [[Bab el Mandeb]] gateway to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]], the country occupies the tip of a region that, due to its resemblance on the map to a [[rhinoceros]]' horn, is commonly referred to as the Horn of Africa.<ref name="factbook"/><ref name="Hadden">Hadden, Robert Lee. 2007.

===Waters===
{{Main|Islands of Somalia}}
Somalia has the longest coastline on the mainland of Africa,<ref>International Traffic Network, ''The world trade in sharks: a compendium of Traffic's regional studies'', (Traffic International: 1996), p. 25.</ref> with a seaboard that stretches {{convert|3,333|km|mi}}. Its terrain consists mainly of [[plateau]]s, [[plain]]s and [[highland]]s. The nation has a total area of {{convert|637,657|km2|sqmi}} of which constitutes land, with {{convert|10,320|km2|sqmi}} of water. Somalia's land boundaries extend to about {{convert|2340|km|mi}}; {{convert|58|km|mi}} of that is shared with Djibouti, {{convert|682|km|mi}} with Kenya, and {{convert|1626|km|mi}} with Ethiopia. Its maritime claims include [[territorial waters]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi}}.<ref name="factbook"/>

Somalia has several islands and archipelagos on its coast, including the [[Bajuni Islands]] and the [[Saad ad-Din Islands|Saad ad-Din Archipelago]]: see [[islands of Somalia]].
[[File:Juba river downstream Jamaame.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jubba River]]]]

===Habitat===
Somalia contains seven terrestrial ecoregions: [[Ethiopian montane forests]], [[Northern Zanzibar–Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]], [[Somali Acacia–Commiphora bushlands and thickets]], [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]], [[Hobyo grasslands and shrublands]], [[Somali montane xeric woodlands]], and [[East African mangroves]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinerstein |first1=Eric |last2=Olson |first2=David |last3=Joshi |first3=Anup |last4=Vynne |first4=Carly |last5=Burgess |first5=Neil D. |last6=Wikramanayake |first6=Eric |last7=Hahn |first7=Nathan |last8=Palminteri |first8=Suzanne |last9=Hedao |first9=Prashant |last10=Noss |first10=Reed |last11=Hansen |first11=Matt |last12=Locke |first12=Harvey |last13=Ellis |first13=Erle C. |last14=Jones |first14=Benjamin |last15=Barber |first15=Charles Victor |last16=Hayes |first16=Randy |last17=Kormos |first17=Cyril |last18=Martin |first18=Vance |last19=Crist |first19=Eileen |last20=Sechrest |first20=Wes |last21=Price |first21=Lori |last22=Baillie |first22=Jonathan E.

In the north, a scrub-covered, semi-desert plain referred as the ''[[Guban]]'' lies parallel to the Gulf of Aden [[littoral zone|littoral]]. With a width of twelve kilometres in the west to as little as two kilometres in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation.<ref name="Hadden"/> This coastal strip is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]].

[[Cal Madow]] is a [[mountain range]] in the northeastern part of the country. Extending from several kilometres west of the city of [[Bosaso]] to the northwest of [[Erigavo]], it features Somalia's highest [[Summit (topography)|peak]], [[Shimbiris]], which sits at an elevation of about {{convert|2,416|m|ft}}.<ref name="factbook"/> The rugged east–west ranges of the Karkaar Mountains also lie to the interior of the Gulf of Aden littoral.<ref name="Hadden"/> In the central regions, the country's northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the ''Ogo''. The Ogo's western plateau, in turn, gradually merges into the [[Haud]], an important grazing area for livestock.<ref name="Hadden"/>

Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River|Shabele]], both of which begin in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba River entering the Indian Ocean at [[Kismayo]]. The Shabele River at one time apparently used to enter the sea near [[Merca]], but now reaches a point just southwest of Mogadishu. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain east of [[Jilib]], near the Jubba River.<ref name="Hadden"/>

===Environment===
[[File:Somcoralreef.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Somalia's [[coral reef]]s, ecological parks and protected areas]]
Somalia is a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] country with about 1.6% [[arable land]].<ref name="factbook"/> The first local environmental organizations were Ecoterra Somalia and the Somali Ecological Society, both of which helped promote awareness about ecological concerns and mobilized environmental programs in all governmental sectors as well as in civil society. From 1971 onward, a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by the Siad Barre government to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind-driven [[sand dune]]s that threatened to engulf towns, roads and farm land.<ref>''National Geographic'', Vol. 159, National Geographic Society, 1981, p. 765.</ref> By 1988, 265 hectares of a projected 336 hectares had been treated, with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established.<ref name="Hadden"/> In 1986, the Wildlife Rescue, Research and Monitoring Centre was established by Ecoterra International, with the goal of sensitizing the public to ecological issues. This educational effort led in 1989 to the so-called "Somalia proposal" and a decision by the Somali government to adhere to the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), which established for the first time a worldwide ban on the trade of elephant [[ivory]].

Later, [[Fatima Jibrell]], a prominent Somali environmental activist, mounted a successful campaign to conserve old-growth forests of [[acacia]] trees in the northeastern part of Somalia.<ref name="Gilbert"/> These trees, which can live for 500 years, were being cut down to make charcoal which was highly in demand in the Arabian Peninsula, where the region's [[Bedouin]] tribes believe the acacia to be sacred.<ref name="Gilbert">Geoffrey Gilbert (2004) ''World poverty'', ABC-CLIO, p. 111, {{ISBN|1-85109-552-7}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hornrelief.org/goldman-prize-2002.htm |title=Goldman Prize |publisher=Horn Relief |date=22 April 2002 |access-date=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712071037/http://www.hornrelief.org/goldman-prize-2002.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010  }}</ref><ref name="IWD">{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/women_env/w_details.asp?w_id=397 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214204154/http://www.unep.org/women_env/w_details.asp?w_id=397 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 February 2007 |title=International Women's Day – 8 March 2006 – Fatima Jibrell |publisher=Unep.org |date=8 March 2006 |access-date=27 June 2010 }}</ref> Being a relatively inexpensive fuel, the production of charcoal often leads to [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]].<ref name="IWD"/> As a way of addressing this problem, Jibrell and the Horn of Africa Relief and Development Organization (Horn Relief; now [[Adeso]]), an organization of which she was the founder and executive director, trained a group of teens to educate the public on the permanent damage that producing charcoal can create. In 1999, Horn Relief coordinated a peace march in the northeastern Puntland region of Somalia to put an end to the so-called "charcoal wars". As a result of Jibrell's lobbying and education efforts, the Puntland government in 2000 prohibited the exportation of charcoal. The government has also since enforced the ban, which has reportedly led to an 80% drop in exports of the product.<ref name="Goldman">{{cite web |title=Fatima Jibrell |publisher=Goldman Environmental Prize |url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/113 |access-date=27 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161616/http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/113 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Jibrell was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2002 for her efforts against environmental degradation and desertification.<ref name="Goldman" /> In 2008, she also won the [[National Geographic Society]]/[[Buffett Foundation]] Award for Leadership in Conservation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conservation Heroes Honored by National Geographic, Buffett Foundation |work=National Geographic |date=11 December 2008 |url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2008/12/conservation-heroes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912034421/http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2008/12/conservation-heroes.html |archive-date=12 September 2009 |access-date=27 June 2010}}</ref>

Following the massive [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami of December 2004]], there have also emerged allegations that after the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War]] in the late 1980s, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves that battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tons of nuclear and toxic waste that might have been dumped illegally in the country by foreign firms.<ref name="Toxic">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article418665.ece |title=Somalia's secret dumps of toxic waste washed ashore by tsunami |work=The Times |date=4 March 2005 |access-date=25 February 2009 |location=London |author=Jonathan Clayton |archive-date=10 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810033244/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article418665.ece |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[European Green Party]] followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the [[European Parliament]] in [[Strasbourg]] copies of contracts signed by two European companies — the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian [[waste broker]], Progresso — and representatives of the then President of Somalia, the faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million).<ref name="Toxic"/>

According to reports by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the waste has resulted in far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal haemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of [[Hobyo]] and [[Benadir]] on the Indian Ocean coast — diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP adds that the situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia, but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.<ref name="Toxic"/>

===Climate===

[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map v2 SOM 1991–2020.svg|thumb|300x300px|Köppen–Geiger climate classification map at 1-km resolution for Somalia 1991–2020]]
Owing to Somalia's proximity to the [[equator]], there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic [[monsoon]] winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from {{convert|30|to|40|C|F}}, except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In Mogadishu, for instance, average afternoon highs range from {{convert|28|to|32|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in April. Some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country; [[Berbera]] on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}} from June through September. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from about {{convert|15|to|30|C|F}}.<ref name="Hadden"/> The greatest range in climate occurs in northern Somalia, where temperatures sometimes surpass {{convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in July on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during December in the highlands.<ref name="ClimateSom"/><ref name="Hadden"/> In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.<ref name="Hadden"/> Unlike the climates of most other countries at this latitude, conditions in Somalia range from arid in the northeastern and central regions to [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] in the northwest and south. In the northeast, annual rainfall is less than {{convert|4|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}; in the central plateaus, it is about {{convert|8|to|12|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation, however, receive considerably more rain, with an average of {{convert|20|to|24|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} falling per year. Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically dry and hot.<ref name="Hadden"/>

{{anchor| seasons}}
There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. From December to March is the ''Jilal'', the harshest dry season of the year. The main rainy season, referred to as the ''Gu'', lasts from April to June. This period is characterized by the southwest monsoons, which rejuvenate the pasture land, especially the central plateau, and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation. From July to September is the second dry season, the ''Xagaa'' (pronounced "Hagaa"). The ''Dayr'', which is the shortest rainy season, lasts from October to December.<ref name="Hadden"/> The ''tangambili'' periods that intervene between the two monsoons (October–November and March–May) are hot and humid.<ref name="Hadden"/>

===Wildlife===
{{Main|Wildlife of Somalia}}
[[File:Sambalaxx.jpg|thumb|left|A camel in the northern mountains]]
Somalia contains a variety of mammals due to its geographical and climatic diversity. Wildlife still occurring includes [[cheetah]], [[lion]], [[reticulated giraffe]], [[baboon]], [[serval]], [[African bush elephant|elephant]], [[bushpig]], [[gazelle]], [[ibex]], [[kudu]], [[dik-dik]], [[oribi]], [[Somali wild ass]], [[reedbuck]] and [[Grévy's zebra]], [[elephant shrew]], [[rock hyrax]], [[golden mole]] and [[antelope]].

Somalia is home to around 727 species of birds. Of these, eight are endemic, one has been introduced by humans, and one is rare or accidental. Fourteen species are globally threatened. Birds species found exclusively in the country include the ''[[Columba oliviae|Somali Pigeon]]'', ''[[Alaemon hamertoni]]'' (Alaudidae), Lesser Hoopoe-Lark, ''[[Heteromirafra archeri]]'' (Alaudidae), Archer's Lark, ''[[Mirafra ashi]]'', Ash's Bushlark, ''[[Mirafra somalica]]'' (Alaudidae), Somali Bushlark, ''[[Spizocorys obbiensis]]'' (Alaudidae), Obbia Lark, ''[[Carduelis johannis]]'' (Fringillidae), and Warsangli Linnet.<ref>Dickinson, E.C. (Ed.)(2003) ''The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World''. Revised and enlarged 3rd ed., Princeton University Press, Princeton.</ref><!-- exclusive avian species -->

Somalia's territorial waters are prime fishing grounds for highly migratory marine species, such as tuna. A narrow but productive continental shelf contains several [[demersal]] fish and [[crustacean]] species.<ref>FishBase 2004: a global information system on fishes. DVD. WorldFish Center – Philippine Office, Los Banos, Philippines. Published in May 2004</ref> Fish species found exclusively in the nation include ''Cirrhitichthys randalli'' ([[Cirrhitidae]]), ''Symphurus fuscus'' ([[Cynoglossidae]]), ''Parapercis simulata'' OC ([[Pinguipedidae]]), ''Cociella somaliensis'' OC ([[Platycephalidae]]), and ''Pseudochromis melanotus'' ([[Pseudochromidae]]).

There are roughly 235 species of reptiles. Of these, almost half live in the northern areas. Reptiles endemic to Somalia include the Hughes' [[saw-scaled viper]], the Southern Somali garter snake, a racer (''Platyceps messanai''), a diadem snake (''Spalerosophis josephscorteccii''), the Somali [[sand boa]], the [[angled worm lizard]], a spiny-tailed lizard (''Uromastyx macfadyeni''), Lanza's agama, a gecko (''Hemidactylus granchii''), the Somali semaphore [[gecko]], and a sand lizard ([[Mesalina]] or [[Eremias]]). A colubrid snake (''Aprosdoketophis andreonei'') and Haacke-Greer's skink (''Haackgreerius miopus'') are endemic species.<ref>{{cite web |editor-last1=Uetz |editor-first1=P. |editor-first2=Jirí |editor-last2=Hošek |website=The Reptile Database |title=Quick Search |url=http://www.reptile-database.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102083427/http://reptile-database.org/ |archive-date=2 November 2015 |access-date=8 December 2013}}</ref>

According to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[Central Bank of Somalia]], despite experiencing civil unrest, Somalia has maintained a healthy informal [[economy]], based mainly on [[livestock]], [[remittance]]/[[Wire transfer|money transfer]] companies and [[Communications in Somalia|telecommunication]]s.<ref name="factbook"/><ref name="Cbsef2"/> Owing to a dearth of formal government statistics and the recent [[Somali Civil War|civil war]], it is difficult to gauge the size or growth of the economy.

Unlike the pre-civil war period when most services and the industrial sector were [[Government-owned corporation|government-run]], there has been substantial, albeit unmeasured, private investment in commercial activities; this has been largely financed by the [[Somali diaspora]], and includes trade and marketing, money transfer services, transportation, communications, fishery equipment, airlines, telecommunications, education, health, construction and hotels.<ref name="Brcc">{{cite book |author=British Chambers of Commerce|title=The British Chambers of Commerce Guide to African Markets|year=2007|publisher=Ten Alps Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvB0OwAACAAJ}}</ref> [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] economist [[Peter Leeson]] attributes this increased economic activity to the Somali [[customary law]] (referred to as ''[[Xeer]]''), which he suggests provides a stable environment to conduct business in.<ref name="Petletbet"/>

According to the Central Bank of Somalia, the country's GDP per capita {{As of|2012|lc=y}} is $226, a slight reduction in real terms from 1990.

Somalia's economy consists of both traditional and modern production, with a gradual shift toward modern industrial techniques. Somalia has the largest population of camels in the world.{{sfn|A.

=== Agriculture ===
{{See also|Agriculture in Somalia}}
Agriculture is the most important economic sector of Somalia. It accounts for about 65% of the GDP and employs 65% of the workforce.<ref name="Brcc" /> Livestock contributes about 40% to GDP and more than 50% of export earnings.<ref name="factbook" /> Other principal exports include [[fish]], [[charcoal]] and [[banana]]s; [[sugar]], [[sorghum]] and [[Maize|corn]] are products for the domestic market.<ref name="factbook" /> According to the Central Bank of Somalia, imports of goods total about $460 million per year, surpassing aggregate imports prior to the start of the civil war in 1991. Exports, which total about $270 million annually, have also surpassed pre-war aggregate export levels. Somalia has a trade deficit of about $190 million per year, but this is exceeded by remittances sent by Somalis in the diaspora, estimated to be about $1 billion.<ref name="Cbsef2"/>

With the advantage of being located near the Arabian Peninsula, Somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge [[Australia]]'s traditional dominance over the Gulf Arab livestock and meat market, offering quality animals at very low prices.

The Central Bank of Somalia is the official [[Central bank|monetary authority]] of Somalia.<ref name="Cbsef2"/> In terms of financial management, it is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing [[monetary policy]].<ref name="Monpol">{{cite web|url=http://www.somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125062011/http://somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 January 2009|title=Central Bank of Somalia – Monetary policy|publisher=Somalbanca.org|access-date=30 December 2010}}</ref>

Owing to a lack of confidence in the local currency, the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. [[Dollarization]] notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fuelled price hikes, especially for low value transactions.

Somali [[dialect]]s are divided into three main groups: [[Northern Somali|Northern]], [[Benadiri Somali|Benadir]] and [[Maay language|Maay]]. Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the [[Benadir]] coast, from [[Adale]] to south of [[Merca]] including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional [[phoneme]]s that do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]]) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.<ref>Andrew Dalby (1998) ''Dictionary of languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', Columbia University Press, p. 571, {{ISBN|0-7136-7841-0}}.</ref> Benadiri is the main dialect spoken in the country, in contrast to Northern Somali which is the main dialect spoken in Somaliland.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blench|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Blench|year=2006|title=The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List|url=http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf|page=3|access-date=25 April 2021|archive-date=7 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007050740/http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

A number of [[writing system]]s have been used over the years for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the [[Somali alphabet]] is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the Supreme Revolutionary Council formally introduced it in October 1972.<ref>Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain) ''Middle East annual review'' (1975) p. 229</ref> Other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad's writing]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Somalia}}
The [[Ministry of Education (Somalia)|Ministry of Education]] is officially responsible for education in Somalia, and oversees the nation's [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]], [[Vocational education|technical and vocational]] schools, as well as primary and technical [[Teacher education|teacher training]] and [[Nonformal learning|non-formal education]]. About 15% of the government's budget is allocated toward scholastic instruction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/somalia/soedov.htm |title=Somalia – Education Overview |publisher=Wes.org |date=6 May 2004 |access-date=30 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511075522/http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/somalia/soedov.htm |archive-date=11 May 2011  }}</ref> The autonomous Puntland and Somaliland macro-regions maintain their own Ministries of Education.

[[File:Mogauniv1.jpg|thumb|[[Mogadishu University]]'s main campus in Mogadishu]]
Higher education in Somalia is now largely private. Several universities in the country, including [[Mogadishu University]], have been scored among the 100 best universities in Africa in spite of the harsh environment, which has been hailed as a triumph for [[grass-roots]] initiatives.<ref name="Somtroap"/> Other universities also offering higher education in the south include [[Benadir University]], the [[Somalia National University]], [[Kismayo University]] and the [[University of Gedo]]. In Puntland, higher education is provided by the [[Puntland State University]] and [[East Africa University]]. In Somaliland, it is provided by [[Amoud University]], the [[University of Hargeisa]], [[Somaliland University of Technology]] and [[Burao University]].

[[Madrasah|Qu'ranic schools]] (also known as ''dugsi quran'' or ''mal'aamad quran'') remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction. Known as the most stable local, non-formal system of education providing basic religious and moral instruction, their strength rests on community support and their use of locally made and widely available teaching materials. The Qu'ranic system, which teaches the greatest number of students relative to other educational sub-sectors, is often the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas. To address shortcomings in religious instruction, the Somali government on its own part also subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~ginie/somalia/pdf/koran.pdf |title=Koranic School Project|access-date=27 June 2010}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Somali cuisine}}
[[File:Banadir3.jpg|thumb|Assortment of various popular [[Somali cuisine|Somali dishes]]]]
Somali cuisine is an intricate and diverse fusion of a multitude of culinary influences, drawing from the rich tapestry of [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] flavours. This culinary tapestry is a direct result of Somalia's longstanding heritage of vibrant trade and bustling commerce.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi |author-link=Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi

The essential components that form the foundation of Somali dishes encompass staples like [[rice]] and [[pasta]], along with an extensive selection of [[meat]]s ranging from [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] to [[beef]] and [[chicken]]. Aromatic [[spice]]s such as [[cumin]], [[cardamom]], and coriander are frequently utilized to infuse dishes with tantalizing flavors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Report on Somali Diet |url=https://ethnomed.org/resource/report-on-somali-diet/ |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=EthnoMed |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hooyoshousecom |date=2023-06-30 |title=Exploring the Aromatic World of Traditional Somali Spice Blends |url=https://hooyoshouse.medium.com/exploring-the-aromatic-world-of-traditional-somali-spice-blends-3ab93879b74e |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=Medium |language=en}}</ref>

The culinary landscape of Somali cuisine also boasts an impressive assortment of hearty [[stew]]s, traditional [[flatbread]]s, and delectable [[Pastry|pastries]], with highlights like the beloved "[[Lahoh|Canjeero/Lahooh]]", a delightful variation of the tangy fermented [[pancake]]-like [[flatbread]] that is savoured not only in Somalia but also in its neighbouring countries like [[Injera|Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-01 |title=Yemenite Lahoh (Lachoch) |url=https://www.deliciousisrael.com/blog/lahoh |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=Delicious Israel |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi |author-link=Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi |url=http://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri |title=Culture and Customs of Somalia (Culture and Customs of Africa) |date=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-313-31333-2 |page=113}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Somali Anjero (Canjeero) Anjero Somali {{!}} Xawaash.com |url=http://xawaash.com/?p=1548 |access-date=2024-04-22 |language=en-US |archive-date=4 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231004063819/http://xawaash.com/?p=1548 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali culinary tradition is the incorporation of [[camel]] [[meat]] and [[milk]]. They are considered a delicacy and serve as cherished and fundamental elements in the rich tapestry of Somali cuisine.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Guliye |first1=A.Y. |last2=Noor |first2=I.M. |last3=Bebe |first3=B.O. |last4=Kosgey |first4=I.S. |title=Role of Camels ( Camelus Dromedarius ) in the Traditional Lifestyle of Somali Pastoralists in Northern Kenya |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5367/000000007780223669 |journal=Outlook on Agriculture |language=en |publication-date=March 2007 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.5367/000000007780223669 |bibcode=2007OutAg..36...29G |issn=0030-7270|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

[[Bariis iskukaris|Somali rice]], the usual staple for [[dinner]] or [[lunch]], is typically [[Seasoning|seasoned]] and mixed with various [[ingredient]]s such as [[meat]], [[vegetable]]s, and, in a somewhat unique manner, [[raisin]]s, adding a sweet note to the dish. Also, it is not uncommon for this dish to be presented in a visually appealing manner by incorporating multiple colors, as certain portions may be artificially tinted with shades of yellow or orange using [[saffron]] and other [[spice]]s to enhance its aesthetic appeal.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 14, 2013 |title=Somali Rice Pilaf (Bariis Maraq) Riz Pilaf Somali البيلاف الصومالي |url=http://xawaash.com/?p=5892 |website=Xawaash |access-date=22 April 2024 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923064942/http://xawaash.com/?p=5892 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

An enduring testament to the influence of [[Italian Somaliland|Italian colonial rule in Somalia]] is the widespread adoption of [[pasta]] and [[Lasagna|lasagne]] in the local culinary landscape, espicially in the south, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet alongside rice.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Lasagna Landed in Africa |url=https://www.saveur.com/how-lasagna-landed-africa/#:~:text=Somalia%3A%20Colonized,be%20mixed%20in. |website=saveur| date=26 September 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Rose |first=Nick |title=Spaghetti and Bananas Is Somali Comfort Food |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/595dw8/spaghetti-and-bananas-is-somali-comfort-food |work=Vice}}</ref>

[[Tea]] and [[coffee]], both well-loved [[Drink|beverages]], are also really popular. Among the early adopters of [[coffee]] consumption were the Somalis, who have the historical distinction of being among the first individuals documented to have enjoyed this stimulating drink.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Somalia}}
Somalia has a rich musical heritage centred on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]].  Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its unique tunes and styles. Traditional instruments prominently featured in the music of Somalia include the [[oud]] [[lute]]. It is often accompanied by small [[drums]] and a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] [[flute]] in the background. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between [[lyricist]]s ({{lang|so|midho}}), [[songwriter]]s ({{lang|so|laxan}}) and [[Singing|singers]] ({{lang|so|codka}} or "voice").<ref>{{Harvnb|Abdullahi|2001|pp=170–1}}.</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Literature of Somalia}}
The Somali community has been a source of many significant poets, writers, and Islamic figures over the years, a considerable proportion of whom have played a pivotal role in influencing and moulding the trajectory of Muslim scholarship and traditions, not just in the Horn of Africa but also reaching far into the Arabian Peninsula and other regions around the world. Somalia has also been called by, among others, the [[Canada|Canadian]] novelist and scholar [[Margaret Laurence]], a "Nation of [[Poet]]s" and a "Nation of [[Bards]]". Famed British explorer and writer [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] eloquently wrote about Somalia:<blockquote>"The country teems, with 'poets, poetasters, poetitoes, poetaccios': every man has his recognized position in literature as accurately defined as though he had been reviewed in a century of magazines – the fine ear of this people causing them to take the greatest pleasure in harmonious sounds and poetical expressions, whereas a false quantity or a prosaic phrase excite their violent indignation."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Burton |first=Richard |title=First Footsteps in East Africa |date=1986 |publisher=Dover Publications |orig-year=1856 |isbn=9780785519973}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Hadrawi.jpg|thumb|Famed [[poet]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[orator]] [[Hadrawi|Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame (Hadraawi)]]]]
With the adoption of the [[Somali alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in 1972 as the nation's standard orthography, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have received worldwide acclaim. Among these modern authors, [[Nuruddin Farah]] is the most renowned, receiving, among other honors, the 1998 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature|Neustadt international prize for Literature]].<ref name=":32"/> [[Farah Awl|Faarax M.J. Cawl]] is another notable Somali author who is famous for his novel set in the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish era]], ''Ignorance is the enemy of love''. Somali poetry also thrived during this era with [[Hadrawi|Hadraawi]] gaining national renown for his prose and poetry.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sports in Somalia}}

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Somalia. Important domestic competitions are the [[Somalia League]] and [[Somalia Cup]], with the [[Somalia national football team]] playing internationally.

[[Basketball]] is also played in the country. The [[FIBA Africa Championship 1981]] was hosted in Mogadishu from 15 to 23 December 1981, during which the [[Somalia national basketball team|national basketball team]] received the bronze medal.<ref>{{cite web |title=1981 African Championship for Men|url=https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid/AFMSM/sid/2399/_/1981_African_Championship_for_Men/index.html|publisher=FIBA|access-date=15 December 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, a [[Somalia national bandy team]] was formed in [[Borlänge]]. It participated in the [[Bandy World Championship 2014]].

In the [[martial arts]], [[Faisal Jeylani Aweys]] and Mohamed Deq Abdulle of the [[Somalia national taekwondo team|national taekwondo team]] took home a silver medal and fourth place, respectively, at the 2013 Open World [[Taekwondo]] Challenge Cup in [[Tongeren]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Somalia moves forward at world Taekwondo|url=http://horseedmedia.net/2013/03/06/somalia-moves-forward-at-world-taekwondo-pictures/|access-date=19 October 2013|newspaper=Horseed Media|date=6 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022175949/http://horseedmedia.net/2013/03/06/somalia-moves-forward-at-world-taekwondo-pictures/|archive-date=22 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Additionally, Mohamed Jama has won both world and European titles in [[K-1]] and [[Muay Thai|Thai Boxing]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Great Victory for Malta in K1 Kickboxing|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-02-10/others/great-victory-for-malta-in-k1-kickboxing-270164/|access-date=18 October 2013|newspaper=Malta Independent|date=10 February 2010}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Somali architecture}}
[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe]]]]Somali architecture is a rich and diverse tradition of engineering and design. Spanning the country's ancient, medieval and early modern periods, it also embraces the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with contemporary Western designs.

In ancient Somalia, [[pyramid]]ical structures known in Somali as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these [[dry stone]] monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of [[Ashlar|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref>John G. Jackson, J. Hampden Jackson (1972) ''Man, God and Civilization'', Citadel Press, p. 216, {{ISBN|0-8065-0858-2}}.</ref> There are also examples of courtyards and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the Wargaade Wall.

The adoption of Islam in Somalia's early medieval history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]]. This stimulated a shift in construction from dry stone and other related materials to [[Coral rag|coral]] stone, [[Mudbrick|sun dried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs, such as mosques, were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue throughout the following centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abdullahi|2001|p=102}}.</ref>
