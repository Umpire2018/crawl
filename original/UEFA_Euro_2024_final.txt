The '''UEFA Euro 2024 final''' was a [[Association football|football]] match that determined the winners of [[UEFA Euro 2024]]. The match was the seventeenth [[List of UEFA European Championship finals|final]] of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of [[UEFA]] to decide the champions of Europe. The match was held at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] in [[Berlin]], Germany, on 14 July 2024, and was contested by [[Spain national football team|Spain]], in their fifth final, and [[England national football team|England]], in their second final, but their first appearance in a major men's tournament final held outside their home country. Following their defeat in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 final|previous final]], England also became the fourth different side to appear in two consecutive Euro finals, after the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] ([[1960 European Nations' Cup final|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup final|1964]]), [[West Germany national football team results|West Germany]] ([[UEFA Euro 1972 final|1972]], [[UEFA Euro 1976 final|1976]] and [[UEFA Euro 1980 final|1980]]), unified Germany ([[UEFA Euro 1992 final|1992]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996 final|1996]]), and Spain ([[UEFA Euro 2008 final|2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012 final|2012]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Euro 2024 final: England must be 'tactically perfect' to beat Spain – Gareth Southgate|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjerlqzvx73o |website=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=12 July 2024 |date=11 July 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.uefa.com/resources/0288-1999ab91ad50-899894098aed-1000/uefa_euro_2024_match_schedule.pdf |title=UEFA Euro 2024 match schedule |website=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |access-date=3 December 2023}}</ref>

In front of a crowd of 65,600, Spain won the match 2–1 for their record-breaking fourth UEFA European Championship title (after [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]), surpassing [[Germany national football team|Germany]] as the sole record-winners of the competition. It was also their third title in the last five editions of the tournament.

Spain won all seven matches they played in the competition, the first side to accomplish this since [[France national football team|France]] won five out of five in [[UEFA Euro 1984|1984]], and set a new record for most goals scored in a single European Championship, with fifteen. England, meanwhile, became the first side to lose consecutive finals. This was also the first time both finalists conceded in every knockout game contested since the tournament's expansion in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/news/028f-1b5e5c2b7b67-d5faab9be20b-1000/ |title=Spain 2–1 England: Late Oyarzabal winner earns La Roja record fourth EURO crown |work=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=14 July 2024 |access-date=14 July 2024}}</ref>

===Summary===

==== First half ====
Spain won a corner in the early minutes, which was cleared by England, before Spain consolidated possession with frequent passes and opportunities created by [[Nico Williams]]. England then won a free kick after a foul on [[Jude Bellingham]] in about the tenth minute, which [[Luke Shaw]] sent towards the box; a foul on [[Aymeric Laporte]] during this play saw possession given to Spain, and Williams again took the ball to the box. In the opening exchanges, while England prevented Spain from getting a shot on target, they also saw little of the ball and struggled when on it, while Spain appeared more settled and were able to play through the lines.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |last2=Unwin |first2=Will |last3=Smyth (earlier) |first3=Rob |last4=Unwin (now) |first4=Will |date=2024-07-14 |title=Spain 2–1 England: Euro 2024 final – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/jul/14/spain-v-england-euro-2024-final-live-score-updates |access-date=2024-07-15 |work=the Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2024-07-14 |title=España vs Inglaterra EN VIVO Online.

Targeting the same area, behind Spanish defender [[Marc Cucurella]], England won the ball in the 21st minute but quickly lost it again under pressure from [[Dani Olmo]]. Olmo sent the ball over to [[Lamine Yamal]], who had been quieter up to this point with Spain attacking on the other side. Yamal's shot was blocked for a corner, off which England gained possession and launched a counter-attack that was ended when [[Dani Carvajal]] fouled Saka.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the foul was cynical, and noted that Carvajal made a crying gesture towards England players afterwards when England captain [[Harry Kane]] was intervening with the referee about the lack of [[Yellow card (association football)|yellow card]] on Carvajal.<ref name=":0" /> Shaw sent the free kick to the edge of the area; Kane got the ball but followed through, losing it and fouling [[Fabián Ruiz]]. Kane was shown a yellow card,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" /> which [[Marca (newspaper)|''Marca'']] said was deserved.<ref name=":1" /> A few minutes later, Ruiz had a shot towards goal that ran through to the goalkeeper.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" />

In about the 30th minute, Olmo tried to win the ball high but fouled [[Declan Rice]], with Olmo receiving a yellow card; in the 34th minute, Yamal beat Shaw to the ball on the wing and made a good run into the box, with Shaw performing a strong [[sliding tackle]] to send the ball out for a corner, which led to another corner. Yamal sent this to Olmo at the edge of the box, who had his shot blocked.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" /> At this point, ''Marca'' noted that Williams had become quieter;<ref name=":1" /> ''The Guardian'' noted Spain's dominance, though without big chances.<ref name=":0" /> England improved at the end of the first half, with defender [[John Stones]] dribbling through midfield into the final third and sending a through-ball to reach Kane in the area; defenders around Kane prevented him using it and the ball ran out. England then created another opportunity before losing the ball, with Spanish striker [[Álvaro Morata]] carrying it into the box but being blocked by England defenders Stones and [[Marc Guéhi]] for a Spain corner that came to nothing. Bellingham won the ball in England's attacking half and crossed it to Kane, whose shot was blocked by [[Rodri (footballer, born 1996)|Rodri]]. Soon after, [[Kyle Walker]] was fouled to give England a free kick 35 yards from goal; Rice's cross found [[Phil Foden]] at the back post, whose tight-angled shot was saved. After two additional minutes, the first half ended goalless.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" />

==== Second half ====
Rodri suffered a hamstring injury in the first half and was substituted off, replaced by [[Martín Zubimendi]], at half time. Spain was dominant again when play resumed for the second half. In the early moments, Yamal got behind Shaw before moving inside and advancing; he crossed low to an on-running Williams, who scored in the 47th minute with a low shot to the right corner.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" /> ''The Guardian'' said the assist and goal were "almost a mirror image" of [[Pelé]]'s assist and [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]]'s goal in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup final]].<ref name=":0" /> In the goalscoring play, Olmo had made a more central run, which opened space for Williams, and in the subsequent few minutes Williams and Olmo combined to get in two more shots by the 49th minute, without scoring. Zubimendi then led a break in the 53rd minute, with Stones tactically fouling him; Stones was shown a yellow card. From the free kick, Morata took a shot that was blocked by Guéhi. In the 55th minute, Yamal sent a pass forward that found Morata, who had run in behind Guéhi; Morata shot wide, and Stones cleared the ball, only for it to be recovered by Spain. Williams then also sent a shot just wide from the edge of the area. Spain continued to dominate, though England won a foul (on Saka) in their own half in the 56th minute. In the 61st, Kane was taken off for [[Ollie Watkins]]. Saka was fouled again in about the 62nd minute, with England taking it long; Foden sent the ball into the box, but it was headed away. In the 64th minute, Bellingham lost his marker just outside the box and sent a shot just wide. Spain then broke, and Olmo sent the ball forward to Yamal in the 66th minute, who got behind Shaw but was unable to take it with the first touch. Yamal still had the ball, sending in a low shot from the edge of the area that goalkeeper [[Jordan Pickford]] pushed around the post for a corner.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" />

In the 68th minute, Morata was taken off for [[Mikel Oyarzabal]], and in the 70th minute Ruiz sent a good chance over the bar. Looking for a way in to attack, England replaced [[Kobbie Mainoo]] with [[Cole Palmer]]. After Watkins tried a shot from distance in the 71st minute, Spain immediately responded with more attempts. Olmo repeated his through-ball to Yamal, but Yamal was offside, before Oyarzabal had an attempt saved in the 72nd minute. England quickly broke, with Saka running down the wing and crossing to Bellingham in the area; Bellingham gave a first-touch offload to put the ball in front of the on-running Palmer, who scored from outside the box in the 73rd minute with a low shot to the left corner. England had another good run of play after scoring, but Spain were more dominant in possession again by the 78th minute. After taking the ball from England in the midfield in the 82nd minute, Spain took it to the edge of the box, with Olmo and Williams combining to [[Dummy (football)|dummy]] and let it run in for Yamal, whose curling shot was again saved by Pickford. In the 86th minute, Oyarzabal passed short to Cucurella and ran into the box, outpacing his marker as Cucurella crossed the ball back from the left and Oyarzabal scored reaching the ball with his right foot before Pickford; after a check for offside, the review confirmed that Stones' knee was ahead of Oyarzabal's foot and the goal stood. England tried to respond and Bellingham sent a through-ball in to Watkins in the area in the 88th minute, who was unable to control it and take the chance. Both teams then made substitutions, England adding another forward in [[Ivan Toney]] and Spain taking off Yamal. England continued playing urgently, and won a corner in the 90th minute. Palmer sent in the corner, which Rice headed in on target; goalkeeper [[Unai Simón]] pushed this back into the area only for Guéhi to head it over Simón to the goal, but Olmo was on the line and headed this away. The ball went back to Rice, who took a shot that went over the bar. Four minutes were added to the end of regulation time, in the first of which, Watkins received a yellow card for a high tackle. Spain played out the end of the game defensively: England won two fouls in the 92nd minute, before conceding a foul in the 93rd; Cucurella stayed down after being fouled to take the game into the 94th minute. England won another foul, and the match was ended for a Spain victory.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="Athletic" />
