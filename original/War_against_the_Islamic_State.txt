<!-- '''start of lead, end of infobox''' -->

Many states began to intervene against the [[Islamic State]], in both the [[Syrian civil war]] and the [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)]], in response to its rapid territorial gains from its [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensives]], universally condemned [[Killing of captives by ISIL|executions]], [[Islamic State#Human rights abuse and war crime findings|human rights abuses]] and the fear of further [[Spillover of the Syrian civil war|spillovers of the Syrian civil war]]. These efforts are called the '''war against the Islamic State''' ('''ISIS''') or the '''international military intervention against the Islamic State''' ('''ISIS'''). In later years, there were also minor interventions by some states against IS-affiliated groups in [[Nigeria]] and [[Libya]]. All these efforts significantly degraded the Islamic State's capabilities by around 2019–2020. While moderate fighting continues in Syria, as of {{CURRENT YEAR}}, ISIS has been contained to a manageably small area and force capability.

In mid-June 2014, [[Iran]], according to American and British information, started flying drones over [[Iraq]], and, according to [[Reuters]], Iranian soldiers were in Iraq fighting IS. Simultaneously, the [[United States]] ordered a small number of troops to Iraq and started flying crewed aircraft over Iraq. In July 2014, according to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], [[Iran]] sent [[Sukhoi Su-25]] aircraft to [[Iraq]], and [[Hezbollah]] purportedly sent trainers and advisers to Iraq in order to help Shia [[Popular Mobilization Forces|militias]] to monitor ISIL's movements. In August 2014, the US and Iran separately began a campaign of airstrikes on ISIL targets in Iraq. Since then, fourteen countries in a [[US-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021)|US-led coalition]] have also executed airstrikes on ISIL in Iraq and in [[Syria]]. Starting from September 2014, United States began closely co-operating with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] to wage a co-ordinated [[Aerial bombing|aerial bombing campaign]] against IS targets across Iraq and Syria.<ref>{{#invoke:cite web||title=FAQ on the Syrian Civil War |url=https://www.crf-usa.org/images/pdf/syriafaqs.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221222175528/https://www.crf-usa.org/images/pdf/syriafaqs.pdf |archive-date=22 December 2022 |website=Constitutional Rights Foundation |page=6}}</ref>

In September 2015, [[Russia–Syria–Iran–Iraq coalition|Russian forces]] launched their [[Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war|military intervention in Syria]] to support that country's ally [[Bashar al-Assad]] in the fight against the [[Islamic State]]. Although Moscow officially portrayed its intervention as an anti-IS campaign and publicly declared support for the "patriotic [[Syrian opposition]]", the vast majority of its bombings were focused on destroying bases of the Syrian opposition militias of the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) and [[Southern Front (Syrian rebel group)|Southern Front]].<ref>{{#invoke:cite news||title=Syrian rebels to Russia: Stop bombing us|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN0SK0QR20151026|work=[[Reuters]]|date=26 October 2015|access-date=9 December 2015|archive-date=1 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401134059/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN0SK0QR20151026|url-status=live}}</ref> On the other hand, United States and its Western allies have been opposed to the [[Ba'athist Syria|Ba'athist regime]] for its purported [[Foreign policy of Bashar al-Assad#State-sponsorship of terrorism|state-sponsorship of terrorism]], violent repression of [[2011 Syrian Revolution|Syrian revolution]] and extensive [[Use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war|use of chemical weapons]].

In a coordinated effort led by the [[United States]], many allied countries including [[Member states of NATO|NATO members]] and Middle Eastern partners have supplied or plan to supply Iraqi and/or Kurdish forces with heavy military equipment, small arms, ammunition, non-lethal military gear, and training support.

The [[US-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021)#Building Partner Capacity|Building Partner Capacity (BPC) program]] is meant to help the [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] to prepare forces for the counter-attack against ISIL and the regaining of its territory.

Thousands of [[Yazidis]] and other Iraqi civilians fled to the area following attacks on their villages and the town of [[Sinjar]] throughout late July and early August 2014.

Several human rights and observer organizations in the region reported that those who fled to the mountains were subjected to starvation, and lacked clean drinking water and medical care for several months as ISIL [[wikt:Militants|militants]] surrounded them. Hundreds of men, women, and children were abducted and killed.

In response to the immediate threat to the approximately 30,000 people trapped on the mountain, coalition aircraft commenced humanitarian aid drops. These air drops included basic supplies such as food, water, and shelter and were conducted at low flight levels by coalition transport aircraft under the threat of ISIL surface-to-air attacks.

In direct support of humanitarian aid drops, [[CF-18]]s provided top cover for a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft on 20 November, ensuring the transport crew was able to safely parachute supplies to waiting refugees below. [[Canadian Forces|Canadian fighter jets]] remained in close proximity to the transport aircraft to protect it from ISIL [[surface-to-air]] threats or attacks.<ref>{{#invoke:cite web||url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=air-task-force-iraq-takes-part-in-sinjar-mountains-offensive/i55aq34l|title=National Defence – Canadian Armed Forces – Article – Air Task Force-Iraq takes part in Sinjar Mountains Offensive|work=forces.gc.ca|access-date=21 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010084237/http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=air-task-force-iraq-takes-part-in-sinjar-mountains-offensive%2Fi55aq34l|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

This was the third U.S. air strike against Islamic State militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes will continue to target ISIL in [[Sirte]] in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance.

The ''BBC'' reported that ISIL's announcement of the establishment of its [[Afghanistan]]/[[Pakistan]]-based [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province|Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP)]] in January 2015, it was the first time that ISIL had officially spread outside the [[Arab world]].

In the first half of 2015, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province|ISIL-KP]] managed to capture large parts of territory in eastern Nangarhar province. This became the de facto "capital" principally for two reasons: its proximity to the tribal areas of Pakistan, home of ISIL-KP's top leaders; and the presence of some people who follow a similar [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi]]/[[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] interpretation of [[Islam]] to ISIL. ISIL-KP is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] militants; IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000.<ref name="auto2">{{#invoke:cite web||url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39031000|title=IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 February 2017|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-date=12 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190612002843/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39031000|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 23 July 2016, following the [[July 2016 Kabul bombing|Kabul bombing]], Afghan forces and U.S. special forces backed by U.S. airstrikes began an operation to retake parts on [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar province]] from ISIL-KP militants. Over 24 and 25 July whilst clearing areas of southern Nangarhar with Afghan special operations troops, 5 [[United States special operations forces|U.S. special forces]] troops were wounded by small arms fire or shrapnel, making it the first reported instance of U.S. troops being wounded in fighting ISIL in [[Afghanistan]]. On 26 July, one of the most important leaders of ISIL in the region and one of the founders of the ISIL-KP, Saad Emarati, was killed along with 120 other suspected militants in [[Kot District]], Afghan troops pushed into Kot District, meeting little resistance due to heavy air and artillery bombardment that forced ISIL fighters to flee into nearby mountain areas, Afghan forces found an already destroyed training camp. Overall, the operation reclaimed large and significant parts of eastern Afghanistan, forcing ISIL militants back into the mountains of southern Nangarhar with hundreds of IS militants killed; the estimated size of the ISIL-KP in January 2016 was around 3,000, but by July 2016 the number has been reduced to closely 1,000 to 1,500, with 70% of its fighters come from the TTP. In the operation, Afghan forces, backed by the US, killed an estimated 300 ISIS fighters.<ref>{{#invoke:cite web||url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2016/07/28/five-us-troops-wounded-afghanistan-operations-grow/87663788/|title=American troops wounded fighting ISIS in Afghanistan as operations there grow|publisher=military.com|date=28 July 2016|access-date=3 August 2016|archive-date=31 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055958/http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2016/07/28/five-us-troops-wounded-afghanistan-operations-grow/87663788/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite web||url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/29/at-least-5-us-troops-wounded-in-afghanistan-fighting-islamic-state.html|title=At least 5 US troops wounded in Afghanistan fighting Islamic State|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=29 July 2016|access-date=3 August 2016|archive-date=8 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708104104/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/29/at-least-5-us-troops-wounded-in-afghanistan-fighting-islamic-state.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite news||url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-operations-idUSKCN10A0FE|title=Afghan troops press offensive against Islamic State|work=[[Reuters]]|date=30 July 2016|access-date=1 July 2017|archive-date=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331104030/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-operations-idUSKCN10A0FE|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite web||url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/five-us-troops-wounded-afghanistan-military-says-175423691.html|title=Five US troops wounded in Afghanistan, military says|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The ''[[Islamic Emirate of Rafah]]'' ([[:ar:إمارة رفح الإسلامية#:~:text=إمارة رفح الإسلامية كانت دولة,من سيطرة حماس على غزة.|Arabic Wikipedia]]) was a short-lived militant state established by the [[Jund Ansar Allah]], an Islamist group, in the town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. It was declared on 14 August 2009, by [[Abdel Latif Moussa|Abdul Latif Moussa]], also known as [[Abu Noor al-Maqdisi]], during a sermon at the [[Ibn Taymiyyah Mosque]]. The emirate aimed to impose strict Islamic law and was aligned with the ideology of [[al-Qaeda]] and is believed to have been aided by ISIS.<ref>{{Citation |title=إمارة رفح الإسلامية |date=2024-05-27 |work=ويكيبيديا |url=https://ar.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9_%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9&oldid=66992542 |access-date=2024-06-02 |language=ar}}</ref>

[[Jund Ansar Allah]], translated as "Soldiers of the Followers of God," was founded by Abdul Latif Moussa in 2008. The group quickly garnered attention due to its extreme interpretation of Islam and its opposition to the ruling [[Hamas government in the Gaza Strip]] (known locally as the ''Palestinian Government in Gaza'' or ''Palestinian Authority in Gaza''). Tensions between Jund Ansar Allah and Hamas escalated when Moussa declared the establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Rafah, challenging Hamas's authority.<ref>{{Cite web |title=إمارة رفح الإسلامية - ويكيبيديا |url=https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9_%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9#:~:text=%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9%20%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AD%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%20%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9,%D9%85%D9%86%20%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9%20%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89%20%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9. |access-date=2024-06-02 |website=ar.wikipedia.org |language=ar}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2024}}

The proclamation of the [[Islamic Emirate of Rafah]] was seen as a direct threat to the Hamas government, which had been the de facto authority in [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Gaza since 2007]] (after winning the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]] but losing control of the West Bank Region in [[Fatah–Hamas conflict|subsequent conflict]]). In response, Hamas launched a military operation against Jund Ansarf Allah. The confrontation culminated in a fierce battle at the Ibn Taymiyyah Mosque, where Abdul Latif Moussa and several of his followers were killed many of whom were [[Islamic State of Iraq|ISI]] operatives. The emirate was dismantled, and Hamas reasserted its control over Rafah.<ref>{{Cite web |title=الإمارة الإسلامية وأحداث غزة |url=https://www.alsomood.af/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d9%85%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%88%d8%a3%d8%ad%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%ab-%d8%ba%d8%b2%d8%a9/ |access-date=2024-06-02 |website=مجلة الصمود الإسلامية |language=ar}}</ref>
