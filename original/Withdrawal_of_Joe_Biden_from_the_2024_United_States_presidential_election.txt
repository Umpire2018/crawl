On July 21, 2024, [[Joe Biden]], the 46th [[president of the United States]], announced his withdrawal from the [[2024 United States presidential election]] and endorsed Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] as his replacement. Harris subsequently received the Democratic nomination, but ultimately lost the election to former President [[Donald Trump]].

Biden, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], had announced that he would [[Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign|run for re-election]] in the 2024 presidential election on April 25, 2023, with Harris again as his running mate.<ref name="2023-04-25 Associated Press">{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Zeke |author-link1=Zeke Miller |date=April 25, 2023 |title=Biden announces 2024 reelection bid: 'Let's finish this job' |url=https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-election-2024-president-democrats-trump-9c72115656855da89a41cac3f79aa65b |url-status=live |language=en |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |work=[[Associated Press]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240728142647/https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-election-2024-president-democrats-trump-9c72115656855da89a41cac3f79aa65b |archive-date=July 28, 2024 |access-date=July 28, 2024}}</ref> Biden had the support of almost all major donors in Democratic Party politics and went on to win an overwhelming majority of delegates in the [[2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], where he easily defeated challengers such as [[US Representative|Representative]] [[Dean Phillips]]. He was already considered the presumptive nominee before the primaries were over. However, public [[Age and health concerns about Joe Biden|concerns about Biden's age and health]] had emerged during his presidency, particularly about his fitness for the office and ability to carry out a second term.

These concerns increased after [[2024 Joe Biden–Donald Trump presidential debate|the first 2024 presidential debate]], between Biden and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Donald Trump]] on June 27, 2024. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators noting he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers, had a faltering appearance, spoke with a hoarse voice, and failed to recall statistics or coherently express his opinion on several occasions.<ref name="Debate">

==Background==
{{US 2024 presidential elections series}}

===Presidents who did not seek reelection===
{{Joe Biden series|expanded=Presidential campaigns}}
Historically, most sitting U.S. presidents who completed one full term chose to run for a second. The following presidents were eligible for reelection after completing at least one full term in office, but chose not to run:<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 23, 2024 |title=US presidents who did not seek reelection |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidents-who-did-not-seek-reelection/7709836.html |access-date=July 24, 2024 |website=Voice of America |language=en |archive-date=July 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725000326/https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidents-who-did-not-seek-reelection/7709836.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

* [[James K. Polk]] (in office 1845–1849): kept campaign promise to serve only one term
* [[James Buchanan]] (in office 1857–1861): kept campaign promise to serve only one term
* [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] (in office 1877–1881): kept campaign promise to serve only one term
* [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (in office 1901–1909): kept campaign promise to serve only one full term (after serving one partial term){{efn|Roosevelt later had a falling-out with [[William Howard Taft]], his hand-picked successor, and ran again in [[1912 United States presidential election|the election of 1912]].}}
* [[Calvin Coolidge]] (in office 1923–1929): [[I do not choose to run|chose not to run]] after serving one partial term and one full term
* [[Harry S. Truman]] (in office 1945–1953): [[Withdrawal of Harry S. Truman from the 1952 United States presidential election|withdrew from the race]] after serving one partial term and one full term
* [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (in office 1963–1969): [[Withdrawal of Lyndon B. Johnson from the 1968 United States presidential election|withdrew from the race]] after serving one partial term and one full term
Passed by Congress in 1947 and ratified by the states in 1951, the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] imposes a limit of two full terms on presidents.{{efn|A [[grandfather clause]] exemption was made for the president serving when the amendment was passed by Congress; the president at the time was Truman. Johnson was eligible for a third term because his first term, in which he replaced [[John F. Kennedy]] after [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|the latter's assassination]], lasted less than two years.}} Prior to the term limit, many (though not all) presidents followed an informal [[Term limits in the United States#Term limits in the Constitution|two-term tradition]] after a precedent set by [[George Washington]], who chose not to run for re-election after serving two terms.
