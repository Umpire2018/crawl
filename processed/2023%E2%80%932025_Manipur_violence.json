The British administrative control became more intensive after the Kuki Rebellion of 1917–1919 and they continued to administer the hill areas directly until 1947.{{sfn|Sitlhou|2015|pp=71–72}} Scholars believe the colonial administration employed the \"divide and rule\" policy which widened existing divide between the peoples. After Partition of India|Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status. Even though the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission, the seventh amendment (2015) is seen as an attempt by the valley dwellers to grab tribal land. The valley-based Meitei dominate the political establishment. Of the 60 constituencies of the Manipur Legislative Assembly, 40 are held by the valley and 20 are in the hill districts. The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region. Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads, schools or hospitals in the hills.",

Modi delivered a two-hour speech mainly focused on the accomplishments of his government and criticising the opposition for \"defaming India\" through the vote, to which opposition MPs walked out. Afterwards, Modi addressed the conflict, stating that \"there would soon be peace in Manipur\" and that the whole country would get behind resolution efforts. The motion failed as expected due to the overwhelming BJP majority, with it being seen more as a way to force Modi to speak about the matter and showcase the unity and power of the INDIA grouping.",
