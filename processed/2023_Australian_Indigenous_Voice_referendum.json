Instead, the government proposed funding an education campaign to inform Australians about the referendum and to \"counter misinformation\". However, the pamphlet was ultimately retained in order to secure bipartisan support for the bill. Following this, parliamentarians of both houses who had voted for and against the constitutional amendment bill drafted, for inclusion in the pamphlet, 2,000-word essays detailing their ''Yes'' and ''No'' cases, with the text of each essay approved by a majority respectively of the ''Yes'' and ''No'' supporters. This approach was criticised by organisations such as Australian Greens|The Greens, who wanted these statements to be independently fact-checked, as there was no legal requirement for the pamphlets to be truthful. After the pamphlets were released, several media organisations analysed the claims in both essays, with many characterising some in the ''No'' case as \"false\" or \"misleading\". ''No'' campaigners disputed this, however, arguing that fact checkers were labelling as \"false\" claims that remained subject to debate.",

The party's First Nations Network (aka Blak Greens) encouraged members to abstain or vote no, on the basis that the Voice would be a \"powerless advisory body\".\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|Katter's Australian Party}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|Katter's Australian Party}}\n| {{no|Oppose}}\n| Leader Bob Katter (federal MP for the Division of Kennedy) stated that the Voice to Parliament may not cover important issues faced by Indigenous Australians, instead proposing a designated Indigenous senator. However, he has given his support for a referendum. All three of the party's MPs in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland have requested more information from federal and state governments (similar to the Liberals) and said that they could possibly support the Voice. On 16 February 2023, the party announced on Facebook that its MPs would not support the Voice.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|Labor}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|Labor}}\n| {{yes|Support}}\n| Leader Anthony Albanese has given his support and pledged that a referendum would be held. All state and territory Labor leaders support the Voice, however Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said that although she supports the Voice, she believes it should be explained better.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|Jacqui Lambie Network}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|Jacqui Lambie Network}}\n| {{yes|Support}}\n| Having publicly called for more information about the Voice to Parliament in August 2022 and February 2023, party leader Jacqui Lambie expressed support for the Voice in May 2023, and disappointment at opinion polling indicating a decline in public support in August 2023.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|Liberal}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|Liberal}}\n| {{No|Oppose}}\n| Federal leader Peter Dutton had requested more information before his party decided on a position; however some members  declared their own stances. Federal members of the party's Liberal Party of Australia (Tasmanian Division)|Tasmanian branch were divided on the issue {{as of|lc=yes|2023|1|3}}. On 5 April 2023, after a party room meeting, it was announced that the party will oppose the Voice citing constitutional risks. All members of the shadow ministry are bound by this decision but a conscience vote is allowed for backbencher members. The party also proposed an alternative to Labor's initial proposal and supports constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. After the decision, some members of the party indicated they would still support a Voice to Parliament despite their party room's position. Moderates (Liberal Party of Australia)|Moderate backbenchers including Bridget Archer and Andrew Bragg as well as National Right (Liberal Party of Australia)|conservative backbencher Russell Broadbent indicated their support for a Voice. Furthermore, Julian Leeser resigned from his frontbench position as Shadow Attorney-General to support a Voice.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|National}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|National}}\n| {{no|Oppose}}\n| The Nationals at a federal level stated that they oppose a Voice to Parliament, citing concerns that it would not be inclusive of regional areas.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|One Nation}}|\n| {{Australian politics/name|One Nation}}\n| {{no|Oppose}}\n| One Nation opposes both a Voice to Parliament and a referendum on the subject.\n|-\n| {{Australian party style|palmer united}}|\n| United Australia Party (2013)|United Australia Party\n| {{No|Oppose}}\n|Following the \"If you don't know, VOTE NO\" slogan, the United Australia Party stated \"[we] will not support a constitutional change that divides us by race.\"\n|}",

Their analysis showed how negative stories can have the strongest impact on people's attention, and also how far articles on traditional media could reach on social media. At that time, the Yes23 campaign had spent more than any other campaign group; however, they were less geographically focused than spending by ''No'' campaigns. It concluded that while there were many more ''Yes'' than ''No'' ads published, its message was spread over 33 disparate themes, whole ''No'' ads predominantly covered only seven, which were all negative. By the end of September, online advertising by both camps was heavily focused on the Tasmania and South Australia, which were regarded as \"battleground\" states. Fair Australia started using TikTok in May, and was using it far more extensively and proving more successful than the ''Yes'' campaign by October. ''Yes'' campaigners on other social media such as Facebook, X, and Instagram had large followings. This may reflect the fact that the younger demographic on TikTok were more likely to be ''Yes'' voters, and the ''No'' campaign wanted to reach them.",

An interim report commissioned by the Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission group as part of its \"Murdoch Referendum Accountability Project\" was published in September 2023. University of Adelaide academic Victoria Fielding and a team of researchers analysed data on reporting and opinion piece|commentary by News Corp about the Voice between July and August 2023, covering ''The Australian'', ''Herald Sun'', ''The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph'', and Sky News Australia. It found that on the whole, news reporting was unbiased and accurate, but the opinion pieces were almost all in favour of the ''No'' vote. The majority of News Corp's content was commentary, not reporting, so when the various articles and videos were examined together, around 70% of the coverage favoured ''No'' arguments. Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin were the top contributors in favour of a ''No'' vote.",

Labor MP for Division of Lingiari|Lingiari, Marion Scrymgour suggested that 74% of the 11,000 people that live in the division's remote areas voted yes. The highest vote in support of yes in an Indigenous community was in Wadeye, at 92.1%. The Tiwi Islands voted 84% in favour, and Maningrida recorded an 88% yes vote. However, many of these remote communities also had a very low turnout, with Palm Island, which recorded a yes vote of around 75%, having a preliminary participation rate of around 1 in 3. Warren Mundine suggested that the low turn-out in remote communities indicated \"that, at best, most Aboriginal people of voting age in remote communities didn't vote at all, and the percentage who voted Yes was less than 30 per cent\". Election analyst Antony Green argued that drawing conclusions based on a relation between the vote of an electorate and its recorded Indigenous population was an example of the ecological fallacy as the data could not be used to predict the vote of individual voters.",
