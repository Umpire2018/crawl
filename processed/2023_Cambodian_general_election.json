His Majesty the King made the appointment in a royal decree signed. According to the royal decree, the newly chosen prime minister is responsible for submitting the composition of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia for a vote of confidence from the National Assembly, effective immediately. Hun Sen has also said that he will remain prime minister for another 15 days before being promoted to the role of father of the prime minister and other positions. In a statement posted on Hun Sen's Facebook he said, \"Looking back, I was the youngest and longest-serving prime minister in the world\". He added, \"As of August 22, 2023, the day I officially resigned, and as of January 14, 1985, the day the National Assembly voted to give me the confidence to be the Prime Minister, I officially became the Prime Minister. 38 years, 7 months and 8 days is 463 months 2014 weeks and 14,099 days. If you consider the work in the government from January 8, 1979 in the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Prime Minister, Acting Prime Minister and Prime Minister until August 22, 2023, I worked for 44 years, 7 months and 14 days. That would be 535 months, 2,328 weeks and 16,297 days.\"",
