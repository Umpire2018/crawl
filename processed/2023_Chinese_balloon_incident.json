On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. U.S. President Joe Biden described the balloon as carrying two Boxcar|railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment, however stated that it was \"not a major breach\", and that he also believed that the Chinese leadership was not aware of the balloon. The U.S. government said the balloon had a propeller for maneuverability.",

On February 14, Wang elaborated by saying that since 2022, circumnavigation balloons launched from U.S. soil flew over China and other countries illegally more than ten times.",

The Dirección General de Aviación Civil (Costa Rica)|Costa Rican General Directorate of Civil Aviation confirmed the incursion by an object \"not of Costa Rican origin\", which the locals had first seen on February 2. The Colombian Air Force said that on the morning of February 3, it had detected an object with \"characteristics similar to those of a balloon\" at a height of {{convert|55000|ft|m}} and traveling at a speed of {{convert|25|knots|abbr=off}}, and after determining it was not a threat to national security and defense or to air safety, had continued to track it until it left Colombian airspace. Sightings of the balloon were also reported from Venezuela, specifically from Maracaibo. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed those sightings and called the object another Chinese surveillance balloon. On February 6, Mao Ning, the spokeswoman for the Chinese government, confirmed the balloon belongs to China, but said that it was used for \"flight tests\" and was blown off-course in much the same manner as the one spotted over North America. VanHerck revealed on March 7 that China later took down the second balloon.",

The general also touched on a leading theory that the reason that it was flying over the United States, was probably because it was blown off-track, where the balloon had been heading towards Hawaii however winds at 60,000 feet simply came into the equation. Milley said, \"those winds are very high.. the particular motor on that aircraft can't go against those winds at that altitude.\"",
