Donohoe grabbed the attacker, whom Benicio then struck with his motorcycle helmet, knocking him to the ground and incapacitating him. Loren-Guille wrested the knife from the man, suffering minor injuries to his hand and face in the process. After others began kicking the attacker as he lay on the ground, two women—a local and an American tourist—formed a protective ring around him, urging onlookers to wait for the gardaí to arrive. Another man safeguarded the attacker's knife until gardaí could retrieve it.",
