Ramos-Horta won the runoff with 62.1% of the total votes cast. Former President José Ramos-Horta came out of retirement as he stated that incumbent president Francisco \"Lú-Olo\" Guterres had violated the constitution. Guterres had previously refused to swear in several ministers from Ramos-Horta's party on the grounds that they were currently undergoing legal investigations over corruption. Ramos-Horta stated that in the event of winning the presidential election, he would potentially dissolve parliament and call for new elections. He also stated that he wanted to try and improve communication across the governing political parties for the purposes of increasing stability. After his victory over incumbent Guterres, Ramos-Horta declared that he would support the VIII government until the end of its mandate.",

Parties were required to have a woman in at least every third position in their list. Seats were allocated using the d'Hondt method with an electoral threshold of four percent and with the last seat, in the case of several equal maximum numbers, being awarded to the party with the fewest votes. In order to jump the four per cent hurdle (about 26,000 voters), parties can form electoral alliances. Voters who have cast their ballot are marked on their finger with a purple, non-washable ink to prevent double voting.

In his letter to MPs in parliament, he supported the planned introduction of postal voting and documents in Braille, but rejected the parallel polling stations for voters who cannot travel to their home town to vote. These had been introduced for the first time in the last presidential elections and were now to be extended. Ramos-Horta explained that the necessary mechanisms and registers would be lacking to prevent double voting. He also criticised the planned direct forwarding of the counting data to the National Electoral Commission (Timor-Leste)|National Electoral Commission (CNE), although the constitution requires a listing first at the ballot box and then at the municipal level. Moreover, the new electoral law does not mention the new municipality of Atauro, which is why there is no polling station on the island at all. Parliament now had to decide on the amendments requested by the head of state. On 20 March, by 37 votes to 22 (with two abstentions), parliament sent the law back to Ramos-Horta unchanged. If the new law is passed again, the president is obliged to sign it into law.<ref name=\":3\" />",

The tribunal found that in the case of the PDN, no congress or national conference had confirmed cooperation with the other parties, which meant that the entire FAD did not receive registration.

When asked who they would like to see as prime minister, Gusmão could attribute his support to his personal background and work, while for the other politicians the reason is the party behind them.

The event, where representatives of different political forces were to discuss, had been organised by the Youth Movement of the Municipality of Aileu (MJMA). Conceição justified the dissolution with the given period of the election campaign and that debates between the parties could only be organised by the electoral bodies. President Ramos-Horta criticised the action and stressed the constitutional right to organise events and express their views on political issues. When asked by Virgílio da Silva Guterres, the ombudsman of the Provedoria dos Direitos Humanos e Justiça (PDHJ), Conceição expressed regret that he had not wanted to restrict citizens' rights, but only to implement the guidelines of the CNE and STAE. Guterres stressed that this was not the responsibility of the municipal administration, but of the CNE, and Miguel Pereira de Carvalho, Conceição's predecessor as Minister of State Administration, also stated that the municipal administrator had neither the power to decide on the authorisation of such events, nor could he give instructions to the police.The CNRT rejected FRETILIN's proposal of two debates during the election campaign between Alkatiri and Gusmão, as the proposed topics were not considered appropriate. The topics were the agreement on the Timor Gap|maritime dispute and border with Australia that Gusmão had negotiated and the Haksolok ferry construction affair. The CNRT is held partly responsible for the fact that the ferry is not in Timor-Leste after years following the bankruptcy of the Portuguese shipyard. In the vote on the border treaty, Alkatiri had FRETILIN vote against it in parliament, which he is accused of betraying. However, Alkatiri sees mistakes in the treaty and wanted to confront Gusmão with them. Likewise with mistakes in politics, of which Gusmão would pretend that he had never led the government in the last 15 years.",

These parties and their \"unscrupulous leaders\" would manipulate youth and turn martial arts into a political tool. Ramos-Horta hinted that he might not approve a cabinet that includes such parties. The head of state emphasised that martial arts itself and the connection of some groups to Indonesia were not the problem. Ramos-Horta explained that he would be concerned if such a party were to head the Ministry of the Interior (Timor-Leste)|Ministry of Interior, for example, in a coalition, with a budget of $100 million; a direct reference to the current government. Deputy Interior Minister Antonino Armindo belongs to KHUNTO, which is closely linked to the martial arts organisation Korka. In addition to KHUNTO, the Greens also have close links with a martial arts group, the 7-7. At both parties, members of the martial arts groups and their leaders appear and display symbols and hand gestures of the groups. The non-governmental organisation ''Fundasaun Mahein'' has already warned of an increasing politicisation of the martial arts groups in the country. It also said these groups were infiltrating various state institutions, which \"could contribute to more violence and socio-political instability\". Ramos-Horta called on the population not to vote for such parties.",

The provisional result showed a clear victory for the CNRT, which resulted in a likely majority in the National Parliament together with the PD. The platform of the old ruling parties, Fretilin, KHUNTO and PLP, will probably only get 28 of the 65 seats, less than the CNRT alone, thus failed to unite the majority of seats. The Greens narrowly failed to clear the four-percent hurdle, followed by the PUDD. All other parties got less than one per cent of the vote each. The Fretilin was only the strongest party in its strongholds of Lautém Municipality|Lautém, Viqueque Municipality|Viqueque and Baucau Municipality|Baucau.

The next day, after a meeting lasting more than two and a half hours, the leaders of the parliamentary groups agreed on 22 June as the date for the inauguration. This would be in accordance with the parliament's rules of procedure, which stipulate the 15th day after the Supreme Court has confirmed the election as the latest date. The decision of 5 June was only published in the Jornal da República the following day, so the latest date was 21 June. The CNRT had accepted this interpretation as a compromise, as the old ruling parties continued to insist on a September date for the transfer of power. The election of the President of Parliament will take place on 23 June and the election of the rest of the presidency on 26 June.",
