The following 30 minutes saw Spain score three goals with Redondo, Bonmati and Codina all scoring to give Spain a 4–1 lead at half-time. After Switzerland almost a second goal from Meriame Terchoun, Spain sealed up the match with a fifth coming from Hermoso and securing a spot into the quarter-finals for the first time. Spain's quarter-final opponent was against the Netherlands who finished runner-up at the 2019 World Cup. The opening half saw the Spanish have a goal disallowed while the Dutch had a penalty being waved away. In the 81st minute, Mariona Caldentey scored from the penalty spot to give Spain the early lead after Stefanie van der Gragt had a hand touch the ball. Van der Gragt, who moved forward, got the equaliser nine minutes later with an assist from Victoria Pelova, putting the game into extra time. On the 111th minute, Salma Paralluelo scored the match winner and booked a semi-final spot. In the semis at Eden Park, Spain faced Sweden. They scored first through Paralluelo, before conceding an equaliser by Rebecka Blomqvist.
