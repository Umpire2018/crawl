The Government of Hawaii|state government failed to provide incentives or impose mandates to keep land clear of grass. The shrinking of the agricultural workforce reduced overall firefighting capacity; those workers had traditionally suppressed fires on the land they cared for, and were so effective that sometimes the counties called them for help.<ref name=\"Gomes\" /> In 2022, Trauernicht suggested that Hawaii follow  Common Agriculture Policy|Europe's example by subsidizing agriculture as a Public good (economics)|public good as a form of fire risk reduction.<ref name=\"Wessendorf\" />  In 2023, UH Manoa biogeography professor Camilo Mora estimated the cost of land restoration to mitigate wildfire risk at about $1 billion.<ref name=\"Bush\" />  Despite these calls to action, the Hawaii State Legislature had been unable to make much progress; a 2022 bill to spend just $1.5 million on additional fire risk reduction measures died in a legislative committee.<ref name=\"Bush\" />",

Concurrently, Hurricane Dora (2023)|Hurricane Dora began to intensify to Category 4 strength, which helped to create a large pressure difference between the high-pressure area and the low-pressure cyclone. This pressure difference aided in already significant trade winds moving southwest, and formed strong gradient winds over the islands. (A similar phenomenon occurred during the October 2017 Portugal wildfires during the passage of Hurricane Ophelia (2017)|Hurricane Ophelia.) The exact significance of Hurricane Dora and how it impacted the fires themselves remains somewhat unclear. Meteorologists noted that the storm's center remained more than {{convert|700|miles}} from the islands and that it remained relatively small in size; however it also remained \"remarkably potent for a long time\", logging more hours as a Category 4 hurricane than any other storm in the Pacific for over 50 years.

In a 2021 report, Hawaii officials ranked wildfire risk as \"low\" despite increasing fire acreage and dangers from drought and non-native grasses. The report criticized inadequate funding and lack of fire prevention strategies. Previous wildfires served as a warning, but risks were not adequately addressed. Hawaii's fire management budgets had not kept pace with growing threats, according to the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. Non-native, flammable grasses remained widespread, increasing fire risk. The climatologist Abby Frazier emphasized Hawaii's extreme wildfire vulnerability and called for more serious fire prevention efforts. The 2021 Maui County report had recommended fire hazard risk assessment and replacing non-native grasses, but it is unclear if these recommendations were implemented.",

In the rest of the US wildfire vulnerable areas, particularly in California, PSPS plans have been implemented . Hawaiian Electric also began the installation of 52 weather stations on four islands: 23 on Maui, 15 on Hawai’i Island, 12 on O‘ahu and two on Moloka‘I in fire- susceptible areas to more effectively predict and react to wildfires. The solar-powered stations provide temperature, humidity and wind data that will help determine whether the utility should actuate a public safety power shutoff (PSPS). The meteorological data will be shared with the National Weather Service and other weather forecasters to better predict fire risks state-wide. About half of the $1.7 million invested in the project will be paid through the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.",

There have also been mentions of famous individuals' estates in Hawaii that have not been damaged from the fires, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of blame. Other posts have claimed that wildfires do not occur naturally or that vegetation is not left standing in a natural fire. Real Raw News, a fake news website, promoted falsehoods about U.S. Marines attacking a FEMA convoy fleeing the wildfires and arresting FEMA deputy administrator Erik Hooks.",
