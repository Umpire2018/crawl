The initial attack occurred at the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley during a youth league event, followed shortly by a second shooting at the Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant. Following these events, Card escaped, prompting the Androscoggin County Sheriff's Office to initiate an extensive manhunt and release his photograph identifying him as the suspect.",

In a later statement, Biden urged lawmakers to impose an Assault weapons legislation in the United States|assault weapons ban and introduce more Gun law in the United States|gun regulations, saying it is \"not normal, and we cannot accept it\" and that current safety measures are \"simply not enough\".",
