As a result, the electorate vote was required to be cancelled in the electorate, and a by-election was scheduled for November, after the general election, to determine the MP for Port Waikato. Voters in Port Waikato continued to cast party votes in the general election. Electoral law requires that 120 seats, excluding overhang, are filled proportionally through the general election. Therefore the electoral system provided for a 49th list MP to be elected through the general election and a 121st MP (excluding other overhang seats) through the 2023 Port Waikato by-election|Port Waikato by-election.",

He also announced that National would create a NZ$500 million fund for repairing both state highways and local roads. On 30 July, National announced that it would take a tough stance against gangs. On 31 July, National announced a NZ$24 billion transportation package that included building 13 new roads of \"national significance,\" investing in three new bus \"transport corridors\" in Auckland, upgrading the lower North Island's railway infrastructure, and investing in road infrastructure in both the North and South Islands. Luxon also proposed creating a National Infrastructure Agency to coordinate government funding, promote investment, and improve funding, procurement and delivery.",

While National and ACT have opposed the expansion of Māori wards in local government, ACT has accepted other co-governance arrangements such as Auckland's Tūpuna Maunga Authority and the Waikato River Authority.

On co-governance, 28% of European voters surveyed said that stopping co-governance policies was an important influence on their party vote choice, compared with 17% of Māori respondents. 62% of prospective ACT voters opposed co-governance, compared with 45% of New Zealand First prospective voters and 40% of prospective National voters. Regarding the Treaty, 46% of Māori respondents regarded honouring the Treaty as an important influence on their party vote, compared with 20% of European respondents.

The Social Media Study found that fake news posts remained below 3% throughout the election campaign, with a weekly average of 2.6% over that five week period. Krewel's study also observed that various parties and politicians promoted \"half truths\" or \"small lies\" throughout the campaign. One notable example was the National Party claiming that the Ministry for Pacific Peoples had hosted breakfasts to promote Labour MPs. In truth the Ministry had held these breakfasts to explain the 2023 New Zealand budget to constituents.",

Market research firm Trace Research director Andrew Zhu stated that opinion polls could help the Chinese community to feel more engaged in the political process. On 21 September, Trace Research published the results of a survey which found that 70.9% of ethnic Chinese voters supported the National Party, 13.4% supported ACT, 12.5% supported Labour, and 1.4% supported the Greens. Support for right-wing parties within the Chinese community rose in 2023 while support for Labour declined compared with the 2020 general election. Trace Research found that ethnic Chinese voters were most concerned with rising living costs, law and order, economic growth, racial equality and healthcare.",
