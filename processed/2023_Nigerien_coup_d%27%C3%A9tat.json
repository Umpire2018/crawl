On the same day, ECOWAS leaders said they would immediately enforce a no-fly zone over the country for all commercial flights, and a closure of borders with Niger. A series of sanctions was also announced, including the suspension of all commercial and financial transactions between its member states and Niger and the freezing of assets and travel restrictions for military personnel involved in the coup. A planned 30 billion CFA franc ($51 million) bond issuance by Niger scheduled for 31 July in the West African regional debt market was cancelled by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). Following the expiration of its deadline on Bazoum's restoration, ECOWAS ordered the \"immediate activation\" of its intervention force, but said it still favors a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On 18 August, ECOWAS said it had agreed an undisclosed \"D-Day\" for a possible military intervention to restore democracy in Niger if diplomatic efforts fail, stressing that it would not hold endless dialogue with the junta.",
