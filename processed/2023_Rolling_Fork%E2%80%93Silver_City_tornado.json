Strong mid-level winds between the trough and strong high-pressure area across the Southeastern United States were displaying in models as well. Meanwhile, a quickly deepening low-pressure area was expected to drag a warm front northward, leading to a broad, unstable air mass to its south.{{Clarify|reason=Specify the geography. Northward to where? And what was south of that area?|date=September 2023}} Although some reduction in moisture was expected across Mississippi due to drier air aloft and warm surface temperatures into the 80s Fahrenheit, continued advection of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico seemed supportive of dewpoints in the upper 60s and lower 70's across Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi by the evening hours. Thus, mixed-layer convective available potential energy was expected to rise into the 1,500–2,000&nbsp;J/kg range. Forecasters initially thought that strong forcing of ascent across Arkansas would lead to an organized squall line capable of both tornadoes and damaging winds, whereas more discrete supercells would be possible farther south, particularly along north–south oriented confluence bands in the open Warm front|warm sector. The tornado threat relied on the amount of wind shear in the lower levels, which would aid in sustaining supercells.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}",

The exact location of where the tornado touched down has been debated between academic scholars; its official touch down point was placed south-southwest of the intersection of Turner Road and Grant Road. It tracked northeastward and caused EF1 damage to trees, a power pole, and outbuildings as it crossed Grant Road before moving through the Steele Bayou Canal and into Sharkey County, Mississippi|Sharkey County, downing trees at EF1 intensity. The tornado then rapidly grew in size and strength as it approached Rolling Fork, Mississippi|Rolling Fork from the southwest, snapping and uprooting many trees in a wooded area at EF2 intensity, including some that sustained debarking. The tornado then reached low-end EF4 intensity and produced violent tree damage as it exited the wooded area, where severe debarking occurred, one tree was ripped out of the ground by its root ball, and pieces of shredded trees were thrown into an adjacent field. EF1 to EF2 damage occurred farther from the center of the tornado's damage path as it crossed Bear Lake Road, where a house lost its roof and exterior walls, and two residences west of that home lost significant portions of their roof covering. A mobile home was also rolled in this area. At that time, violent rotation of radar paired with a debris signature prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency by the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi at 8:04 pm CDT; the tornado would remain under this tag for most of its existence. Additionally, there are no public shelters in the town nor are the any in the rest of the Sharkey County and the surrounding counties. Thus, the residents that somehow did receive a warning were forced to take shelter within their homes and mobile homes, which proved to be inadequate.",

One person was severely injured in this area and died four weeks later. Low-end EF4 damage continued as the tornado crossed Mississippi Highway 826|MS 826, where a brick house was flattened, and many trees were debarked and left with only stubs of branches remaining.

Several other well-built businesses and structures were leveled, with only piles of debris remaining; one of the structures had multiple tractor-trailers thrown into it. One of the town's water towers was toppled when flying debris compromised its base, leaving a crater where it impacted the ground. Water towers are not an official damage indicator on the Enhanced Fujita scale; however, the National Weather Service rated the damage done to the tower EF4 with no estimated wind speed. Mechanical engineer Ethan Moriarty determined—assuming that the tower was made from one single piece of metal that was properly anchored and had not suffered environmental corrosion—that winds of at least {{convert|229|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} would be needed to cause the observed damage to the water tower. Another fatality occurred near this area in another mobile home that was destroyed. Some of the most violent damage occurred in the northeastern part of town, where a flower shop housed in a well-built brick building was leveled at high-end EF4 strength, with its concrete foundation slab partially swept clean of debris. The National Weather Service determined that winds up to {{convert|195|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} would have been needed to cause the damage done to the flower shop. The survey team also noted that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity here based on the damage to the shop, but the neighboring building, which was a small salon, was only leveled and not swept away and received a high-end EF3 rating with winds of {{convert|165|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The large tornado then struck a mobile home park on the eastern edge of town as it exited Rolling Fork, where several manufacturing homes were completely obliterated with debris being strewn long distances.

Rolling Fork's funeral director and mayor, Eldridge Walker, said on March 27 that search-and-rescue efforts were \"pretty close\" to finished and authorities believed that everyone had been accounted for. Following major damage to the Sharkey Issaquena Community Hospital and the Delta Health Center, both based in Rolling Fork, the University of Mississippi Medical Center partnered with state agencies to establish a temporary field hospital at the town's National Guard Armory. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) contracted with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross to provide survivors with meals and lodging in hotel rooms for up to six months. By April 11, Mayor Walker said that 500 people—approximately a third of the town's population—remained displaced. To dispose of debris and waste from the tornado's damage, Sharkey County established a burn site on the town's outskirts. On April 10 alone, 260 truckloads of debris made the trip to the burn site. Influencer and YouTuber Ryan Hall, Y'all raised $120,000 through social media to give generators out after the storm. Alejandro Mayorkas and Governor Reeves touring the damage in Rolling Fork on March 26]]The Mississippi Insurance Department stated that insured losses from the tornado were near $100&nbsp;million (2023 USD), with uninsured losses likely even higher.",
