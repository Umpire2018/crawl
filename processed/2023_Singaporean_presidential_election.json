Tharman Shanmugaratnam was the second to speak, pledging to have a \"fair, dignified and honourable contest\", and promised a campaign that \"unites Singaporeans and not divide us\". Tan Kin Lian was the last to give his speech, and emphasised the need to vote for a president \"truly independent\" of the government. Tan also claimed that he was the target of a \"smear campaign\" before the nomination, with regard to his social media posts. However, he later did apologise to those who felt \"uncomfortable\" with his posts.",

On the same day, Ng reiterated the meaning of non-partisan to the media during his walkabout at Marine Parade, that Singaporeans do not want a president \"who's manipulated by either the governing party or by the opposition parties\", in their response to Tan's endorsements. Tharman Shanmugaratnam responded on media during a walkabout at Sengkang that he found it \"absurd\" and concerning that his rivals are \"increasingly sweeping statements\" pertaining to being non-partisan, to which Ng replied that he was \"misquoted\". Tharman urged the voters to take this seriously and felt \"very unfortunate\" when voters spoil their votes in response to politicisation.",

Ng said that \"the time has come\" for a president to be fully non-partisan and said that he was neither endorsed nor represented by a political party, specifically the ruling People's Action Party. He said that the president's role would serve as a \"constitutional check\" on a bad government that might raid the country's reserves, or appoint incompetent or corrupt individuals to key public-service positions. He added that Singapore can \"no longer take for granted\" that it will always have a \"good and honest\" government, adding that there is a need for external checks, as with good corporate governance, and that an \"ownself check ownself\" system is not reliable. He also pledged to \"Do Well, Do Right and Do Good\" to provide resilience of body and mind.",

Tan also highlighted that one could factor his experience as president from making \"sound investment decisions\" at NTUC Income and from representing the country in an international insurance federation.",

He added that the country cannot afford to have a president who may be beholden to political parties, to serve their agenda, and reiterated the flaw in relying on an \"ownself check ownself\" mechanism. He believed the current generational transition of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) government carries \"uncertainties and risks\" which have been due to scandals plaguing the party over the past month – such as the arrests of Transport Minister S Iswaran over allegations of corruption, and the resignations of MPs Tan Chuan-Jin and Cheng Li Hui over an extramarital affair. He also alluded to Tharman, by questioning whether it is appropriate for an ex-finance minister who \"had set fiscal policies to then move across the table and become the president and be a check on the very policies that he had put in place\". He also brought up the 1984 National Day Rally speech of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, stating that Singaporeans should be aware of \"silver-tongued politicians who make empty promises\". He concluded that Singapore needs a truly independent president, like himself, to break from its past of having a president always endorsed by the PAP, to protect the country's reserves from being squandered by a potential rogue government.",

Good Fortune), and singing the national anthem, \"Majulah Singapura\". Tharman visited several sites, such as Marsiling Mall (with Senior Minister of State and Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC|Marsiling's MP Zaqy Mohamad), then Our Tampines Hub, and HDB Hub, to thank supporters. In a prior interview before results were announced, Tharman was \"humbled\" by how Singaporeans had trusted him for many years and called the election a \"vote of optimism for a future\". He also praised his rivals for having \"put full effort and energy into their campaigns\", and respected the voters who did not vote for him, thanking them for \"following the issues closely\". Furthermore, he said that he had not been expecting a \"high degree of endorsement\" but told that there was a fair number of people who normally were against People's Action Party|PAP but who knew this was a presidential election and not a political or general election. He took notice of the generational transition and hoped that his presidency would keep it a respectful one. On 6 September, Jurong GRC residents voiced concerns to Red Dot United, including those relating to the high cost of living, inflation, and the Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST increasing to 9% by year's end.",

Eugene Tan also highlighted Tan's relationship with opposition parties, stating that Tan had \"too [many] oppositional forces [involved in] his candidacy\".

Tharman's campaign was acclaimed by several analysts. Eugene Tan pointed out that Tharman's slogan, \"race is never absent, but it is not the only factor\", would be seen as signifying an evolution of the nation, praised the voters for voting for the merits of his personal qualities and track record, and praised the PAP government for promoting \"multiracial meritocracy\". In another interview, on the ''Mothership (website)|Mothership'' website, Eugene Tan said that \"Singaporean voters are sophisticated\" and that they have treated the presidential election as it is and not as \"a proxy general election or a referendum on the People's Action Party (PAP)\". In answer to a question on how the result will be an indication of the 2025 Singaporean general election|next general election, he warned that the PAP should not treat this result as the \"ground being sweet\", reminding that parliamentary elections are different, as they are elections between parties rather than individuals.",

Similar to preceding presidents after Benjamin Sheares, Tharman said he would not be residing at The Istana so that he would remain actively involved with Singaporeans. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave a speech where he said that the election meant the voters had said that the \"race is a smaller factor now\" and Tharman's election was \"on his merits, by an overwhelming majority\". Lee added that he respected Tharman's \"long and distinguished\" career and would look forward for their cooperation. In Tharman's inauguration speech, he swore to be \"scrupulous and independent\" in fulfilling his presidential role and to carry out the president's custodial powers. He also promised to unify Singapore, to \"make us a better society, and add to our ballast as we face a more turbulent world\", citing \"we only truly succeed when we succeed together\". The president being an international diplomat, his maintaining Singapore's principles—in the wake of the current economic trends, the China–United States relations, and the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine—was important. He again mentioned that \"we must not allow any of our differences to divide us\" and again reminded people that Singapore must make sure that \"COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 would not be Singapore's last crisis\". The inauguration was witnessed by all cabinet ministers (except S Iswaran), emeritus Senior Minister of Singapore|Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, and former president Tony Tan, along with their spouses; Lee's wife Ho Ching was absent on that day.",

Halimah revealed in the final days of her presidency that she recalled on the controversial walkover of the preceding presidential election, but reflected that she was \"a president for all people, regardless of race, language, religion\", and reflected on the early days of her presidency when security concerns were raised, given that she resided in public housing in Yishun at the time. She also announced her retirement after nearly 22 years of political involvement, and said that she would continue to work with the community \"in different capacities\", raising awareness for mental health and helping people with disabilities, and with empowering women and advocating for a meritocracy. In her final remarks of her farewell speech, she reminded Singaporeans must retain its values of unity and purpose. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his response at her farewell reception later that night, thanked her for fulfilling her promise to be a \"President for everyone\" and for her commitments during her tenure. MeWATCH and CNA posted a video dedicated to her presidency. On 1 October, Halimah was named as the new chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. On 25 October, she was awarded the Darjah Utama Temasek|Order of Temasek (with High Distinction).",
