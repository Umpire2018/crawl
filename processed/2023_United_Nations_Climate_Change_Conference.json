Its average air temperature has risen by 1.27&nbsp;°C (2.29&nbsp;°F) between 1990 and 2022. The Red Sea and Persian Gulf have exceeded safe wet-bulb temperature thresholds several times. Other impacts felt in the region are more frequent dust storms, sea level rise and drought. The UAE has committed to reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050; the first Middle Eastern government to make such a pledge. It was also the first country in the region to sign the Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016. The country has invested $50 billion into clean energy internationally and promised an additional $50 billion by 2030.",

The climate envoys of the U.S. (John Kerry), China (Xie Zhenhua (politician)|Xie Zhenhua) and the EU (Frans Timmermans) met regularly to discuss priorities and planning. On 15 November, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to triple global renewable energy use by 2030. The agreement included a commitment to addressing greenhouse gases, but was criticised for not including a commitment from China to phase out coal-fired power plants. Insiders cautiously expressed hope for a climate agreement between China and the United States ahead of the conference, similar to the agreement of 2014 that paved the way for the Paris Agreement. China published a plan to reduce methane emissions ahead of the conference, but there was expected contention on Coal in China|coal use in China. China characterises coal as essential for its energy security, although others say energy security could be improved through upgrades to the energy grid and domestic energy market. Talks between Janet Yellen and He Lifeng yielded a decision to enhance cooperation between the countries on climate related issues and much was expected from the meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping later in the month at the 2023 APEC summit.",

This type of overview was established during the 2021 COP26 in Glasgow and is scheduled to be repeated every five years. The report concluded that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed, something that the United Nations had previously avoided saying. Among the 17 key findings of the report are:\n* The Paris Agreement and the resulting climate action significantly helped in reducing emissions. In 2011 the projected warming by 2100 was 3.7–4.8&nbsp;°C. After COP27 it was 2.4–2.6&nbsp;°C and in the best case, if all pledges are accomplished, 1.7–2.1&nbsp;°C.\n* As of September 2023, the world is not on track to reach the targets of the Paris Agreement. For having a more than 50% chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5&nbsp;°C and more than 67% chance of limiting it to 2&nbsp;°C, global emissions must peak by the year 2025.\n* Trillions of dollars are needed for limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C.\n* More effective international cooperation and collaboration are crucial for reaching the targets of the Paris Agreement.",

Twenty-three thousand five hundred of the participants were from government teams. A further 27,000 were policy experts, academics and representatives of fossil fuel producers, although this group was not given access to official negotiations. An additional 400,000 people were granted access to the surrounding \"green zone\", a conference space for activists and businesses. The number of attendees and the use of private jets by many of them was the subject of some criticism. The meeting was estimated to have the largest carbon footprint of any climate summit to date.",

FairSquare, a UK-based human rights group, released a report based on testimonies and photographs, stating that the migrant workers were being exposed to dangerously hot weather and humidity to prepare for the climate summit. According to the rights group, in September 2023, a dozen migrant workers from Asia and Africa were working outdoors in temperatures hitting {{cvt|42|C}} despite a midday ban. COP28 denied the allegations and claimed that no evidence of the midday ban's breach was found. A worksite supervisor said most of the work is done at night, but some has to be done whenever possible. A COP28 spokesperson said contractors were required to have worker heat safety plans and weather stations that monitor the thermal work limit, as well as taking into account heat and humidity metrics including wet and dry bulb temperature and wind speed.",

Amnesty opposed the \"unlawful electronic surveillance of conference participants [and of] Emirati nationals and residents\". It said that the COP28 attendees should be allowed to download \"privacy-respecting international communications applications\" in the UAE that would ensure safe and encrypted means of communication.",

McKinsey has been accused of putting its own interests ahead of the climate by sources involved in preparatory meetings for COP28.

Described as \"incredibly concerning\" and bordering on climate denial, his comments contradict the stance of UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The remarks were made during a confrontational exchange with Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group, at a live online event on 21 November. ''The Times'' noted widespread condemnation of Al Jaber's statements at COP28, where numerous countries, including the UK and EU members, advocated for the phased reduction of unabated fossil fuels. In contrast, former U.S. vice president Al Gore emphasised the historical significance of a potential COP28 agreement to phase out fossil fuels, considering it one of the most crucial events in human history. Simultaneously, BBC News reported a substantial increase in the United Arab Emirates' oil production, with ADNOC, the state oil firm, projected to drill 42% more by 2030. Despite this, ADNOC claims it aims to enhance climate-friendliness, including venturing into renewable energy, amid the global call for fossil fuel reduction.",

Save our planet and our future.\", and gave a brief speech. She was given a round of applause by the audience and removed from the session by security personnel. According to Kangujam, she was banned from further participation in COP28. Other activists criticised the UAE's heavy restrictions on protests, which Human Rights Watch called \"shocking\". Protests at the summit were largely confined to the \"blue zone\", an area under UN control where local laws do not apply. In the blue zone, local activists used COP28 as a platform for human rights demonstrations that are rare and generally not permitted in the UAE.",

This raised concerns about potential violations of the state's code of conduct. In February 2024, Councilors Daniel Fontaine and Paul Minhas filed a complaint against Johnstone, alleging that he violated state laws by accepting gifts to attend the COP28 summit. This lead to an investigation by ethics commissioner Jennifer Devins. In her September 2024 report, Devins concluded that while Johnstone's attendance was relevant to his mayoral duties, accepting gifts like travel and accommodation was not aligned with his official responsibilities.",

As a reaction, Greenpeace published a press release calling for Arab countries to phase out fossil fuels by 2050, ensuring a just transition. Greenpeace said that \"The latest research from Christian Aid and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna shows that both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia face a GDP growth reduction of −72% by 2100 if the global temperature rise is allowed to reach 3 °C.\" The study called ''Mercury Rising: the economic impact of climate change on the Arabian Peninsula'' predicts a 69% drop in GDP growth for countries at the Persian Gulf in average, with the highest impact on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE if temperatures will reach this level. If temperature rise will be limited to 1.5 degrees, the reduction in economic growth will be limited to 8.2% by 2050 and 36% by 2100.",
