The crash was the second incident involving a Legacy 600, following a 2006 mid-air collision with Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 in Brazil, during which the Legacy was damaged but was able to land safely without a casualty, while the commercial airliner crashed, killing all 154 people aboard. That incident was later attributed to human and communication errors. There is no record of any Legacy 600, of which about 300 were built before production stopped in 2020, suffering an accident due to mechanical failure.<ref name=\"Guardian24082023\"/>",

The channel claimed that residents near the crash site heard two distinct loud noises before the incident and observed two vapor trails. A source from the Russian government told ''The Moscow Times'' that the possibility of a shootdown was being considered due to the crash site's proximity to Vladimir Putin's residence in Valday, Novgorod Oblast|Valdai. This area hosted multiple divisions of S-300 missile systems, and the nearby Borisovsky Khotilovo (air base)|Khotilovo and Migalovo (air base)|Migalovo airbases were equipped with Pantsir missile system|Pantsir systems. ''Meduza'' discounted the possibility of a SAM strike, saying that the reported twin exhaust trails and explosions would suggest that two missiles were fired, a common air-defense tactic intended to guarantee a hit, but Flightradar24 data indicates that the aircraft was flying too high to be hit by a short-range man-portable air-defense system, while a hit from a more potent medium-range SAM{{snd}}and particularly two of them{{snd}}would cause much more severe and readily identifiable damage.
