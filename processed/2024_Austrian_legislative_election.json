                  "text": "The ÖVP–Green government decided in early 2023 to reform the voting law. Among the reforms were the introduction of an early voting period, beginning three weeks before election day, during which voters can request absentee ballots in every municipality. Voters can either fill out the ballot in the municipality and therefore cast the ballot early, or take the absentee ballot with them and cast it later by mail, or in-person before or on election day. Previously, this was only possible in large cities. Another reform will be the counting of almost all absentee and mail-ballots on election day. Previously, most mail ballots were counted on the Monday and Thursday after election day. The new changes would lead to most votes being counted on election day, while only a much smaller number of late-arriving mail ballots and mail ballots from electoral districts other than the voters' own district will be counted on the Monday after election day. The 2024 European Parliament election in Austria was the first national election in which the new law took effect, and it showed that only about 130,000 absentee ballots had to be counted on the Monday after election day, compared to almost 960,000 on the Monday after the 2019 legislative election. Other reforms include measures to lower the number of invalid or spoilt votes among absentee/mail ballots, by re-designing mail ballot instructions and introduction of \"easy language\" (or plain language) on them. High fines and a prison sentence of up to two weeks will be introduced for election commission members who deliberately leak election results of their polling stations to the media or other third parties before poll closing time. The reform of the voting law, which took effect on 1 January 2024, was also supported by the three opposition parties SPÖ, FPÖ and NEOS, after several amendments were made to satisfy these parties too. The reformed election law was approved by the Nationalrat (National Council) on 31 January 2023 and by the Bundesrat (Federal Council (Austria)|Federal Council) on 16 February 2023.",
