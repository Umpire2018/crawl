              "text": "{{Further|Quota system of Bangladesh Civil Service}}\nAfter the High Court ruled in favor of quotas on 5 June 2024, the students of various universities in Dhaka united to demand quota reform. After the movement was initially started, it was postponed due to Eid al-Adha and the summer holidays. After the holidays, the agitation started again peacefully but gradually became widespread. Initially, the students and teachers of many public universities and other educational institutions joined the movement. Later, the students of private universities also followed suit by joining the public demonstration. Under the banner of Anti-discrimination Students Movement ({{langx|bn|বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলন}}), students started the '''Bangla Blockade'''. During the movement, the Appellate Division issued a status quo for four weeks on 10 July, canceling the freedom fighters' quota. Reacting to the court verdict, the students said they are seeking a final solution to the quota issue from the government, claiming the movement has nothing to do with the court. The protest also affected the domestic train and road transportation networks across Bangladesh.",

Demonstrations spread nationwide as the movement became headed by a newly formed Anti-discrimination Students Movement, an umbrella organisation for the student protesters. On July 7, protestors launched the nationwide Bangla Blockade, obstructing traffic and rail in major cities and metropolises including Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Jessore, Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Bogra|Bogura. While the Appellate Division, Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Appellate Division ordered a four-week status quo regarding the quota on 10 July, protesters continued to demand a solution from the government. Protests turned violent for the first time the next day as the police clashed with the students. On 14 July, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made #Razakar remarks|controversial remarks about the anti-quota protests, escalating the situation and raising the public's anger. On 15 July, the ruling Awami League solidified its stance against the demonstrations, and the protestors met first violent suppression from the Bangladesh Chhatra League|Chhatra League leaving several hundred injured. In response to the Chhatra League attacks, student protesters at Rajshahi University vandalized halls, targeting the room of the President of RU Chhatra League and other members associated with the group. The protesters in Dhaka University removed Chhatra League members from Dhaka University#Residential halls and hostels|11 different halls and declared a ban on the pro-quota student organization. At other universities across the country, students expelled Chhatra League members from their campuses, with some members in Chittagong even being thrown from high rooftops by angry protesters during clashes. These actions led to many campuses independently declaring themselves \"Chhatra League Free\".",

During the conflict, the police fired tear gas shells, sound grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun rounds. Several areas of the city, including Satmatha, Circuit House Mor, Romena Afaz Road, Kalibari Mor, Bir Muktijoddha Rezaul Baki Road, and Jailkhana Mor, turned into battlegrounds. At least six students were shot, and an additional 50 students were injured. On this day the movement ended and was succeeded by the Non-cooperation movement (2024).",

Of these, nearly 400 deaths were reported from 16 July to 4 August, while around 250 people were reportedly killed following the new wave of protests between 5 and 6 August. [...] The reported death toll is likely an underestimate, as information collection has been hindered by restrictions on movement due to the curfew and the internet shutdown. Furthermore, hospitals were reportedly prevented by State authorities from providing details of those killed and injured.
