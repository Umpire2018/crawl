The UDC garnered 36% of the votes and 15 seats, two fewer than its 2014 result. The election marked a significant political realignment in Botswana's political landscape. This was because the Central District (Botswana)|Central District (which had consistently supported the BDP, averaging around 75% of the vote since the first elections in 1965 Bechuanaland general election|1965) saw large swings to the opposition due to former President Ian Khama's backing of the newly-formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and of UDC candidates, where the BPF did not stand candidates of its own. The UDC and BPF won 11 out of 17 seats in the district, marking the first time ever that a party other than the BDP won a seat in the district. Nonetheless, the BDP made substantial gains in other regions, securing all seats in both Gaborone and districts in the southern parts of the country, offsetting the UDC's advances. The election outcome described as an Upset (competition)|upset was attributed to President Masisi's efforts to reconcile with segments of society previously at odds with Khama, such as labour unions, whose support had waned in the 2014 election. The rapprochement between the UDC leadership and Khama, who remains unpopular among urban and southern voters, led to a loss of support for the UDC among its traditional opposition base in the south.<ref name=\":0\" />",

The total number of people who registered during the general registration was 764,539. Following a lower-than-expected number of registered electors after the general registration, two supplementary voter registration periods were held. The first, from 26 February to 15 March, added an additional 74,404 registered electors. The second and final supplementary registration took place from 20 to 31 May and was conducted across approximately 2,808 nationwide polling stations, unlike the first, which was held at harder-to-reach district commissioners' offices and Kgotlas. This phase yielded an additional 197,021 registered electors.",

Significant swings toward the Umbrella for Democratic Change in the southern and central regions, alongside losses to the Botswana Congress Party in the north, saw the BDP reduced to a rump of four seats, making it the smallest of four factions in the National Assembly of Botswana|National Assembly. The BDP actually finished with the second-highest vote share, behind the UDC. However, its support was spread out across the entire country, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into seats. Since the first-past-the-post system awards power solely on the basis of seat count, this decimated the BDP caucus. Conversely, the BCP, despite finishing over 79,000 votes behind the BDP, became the official opposition due to its heavy concentration of support in the north.\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\"\n|+Botswana general election results (30 October 2024)\n| colspan=\"10\" |↓\n|- style=\"color:black;\"\n| style=\"background:{{party color|Umbrella for Democratic Change}}; width:59.02%;\" | 36\n| style=\"background:{{party color|Botswana Congress Party}}; width:24.59%;\" | 15\n| style=\"background:{{party color|Botswana Patriotic Front}}; width:8.20%;\" | 5\n| style=\"background:{{party color|Botswana Democratic Party}}; width:6.56%;\" | 4\n| style=\"background:{{party color|Independent politician}}; width:1.64%;\" | 1\n|-\n| UDC\n| BCP\n| BPF\n| BDP\n| {{abbr|Ind.|Independent}}\n|}\n{{Election results\n|image= \n|alliance1=Umbrella for Democratic Change|Umbrella for<br>Democratic<br>Change|aspan1=5|party1=Botswana National Front|votes1=193166|seats1=23|sc1=+19\n|party2=Alliance for Progressives|votes2=46799|seats2=6|sc2=+5\n|party3=Independent politician|Independents|votes3=39261|seats3=3|sc3=+3\n|party4=Botswana People's Party|votes4=31636|seats4=4|sc4=+4\n|atotalnv5=y|avotes5=310862|aseats5=36|sc5=+21\n|alliance8=Botswana Congress Party|votes8=175326|seats8=15|sc8=New\n|alliance9=Botswana Patriotic Front|votes9=69414|seats9=5|sc9=+2\n|alliance7=Botswana Democratic Party|votes7=254633|seats7=4|sc7=−34\n|alliance10=Botswana Republican Party|votes10=3212|seats10=0|sc10=New\n|alliance11=Botswana Movement for Democracy|votes11=1146|seats11=0|sc11=0\n|alliance12=Real Alternative Party|votes12=222|seats12=0|sc12=0|acolor12=#76402b\n|alliance13=Independents|votes13=20434|seats13=1|sc13=+1\n|row14=Appointed and ''ex officio'' members|seats14=8|sc14=0\n|invalid=10145\n|total_sc=+4\n|electorate=1038275\n|source= [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XFVIJg83lieiaQcR44l0qk9DFnhCwcaPL1QalB-tBo/edit?gid=1661938075#gid=1661938075  Compilation of Results by Constituency] (61/61 declared); (electorate/turnout)\n}}",
