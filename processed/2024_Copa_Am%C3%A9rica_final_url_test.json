In the 20th minute, Ángel Di María attacked from the left and sent the ball to the box for Lionel Messi to find it, which shot on target but Álvarez unintentionally blocked the shot and changed his direction and power, thus letting Camilo Vargas pick the ball calmly. Córdoba was Yellow card (football)|booked in the 27th minute after a foul on Lisandro Martínez in Argentina's box.
