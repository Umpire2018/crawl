Finnair reported that they were having trouble sending emails and SMS messages to customers. In Greece, citizens and tourists saw delays at major airports, notably at Athens International Airport and at Heraklion International Airport. This disruption, occurring at the peak of the tourist season, resulted in chaotic scenes as passengers were forced to wait for hours for their flights. Contributing factors included severe staff shortages and new schedules. In Heraklion, eight flights were problematic. The airport's chief, George Pliakas, indicated that flights were being manually arranged to manage the disruption, but the influx of arriving flights strained the system.",
