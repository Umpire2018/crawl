The court issued its verdict on 13 September, and sentenced 37 defendants to death, including Marcel Malanga, Zalman-Polun, Thompson, Wondo, a British national of Congolese origin, and a Canadian national of Congolese origin. The remaining 14 defendants were acquitted. The convicted were also ordered to pay more than 145 billion Congolese francs ($50 million) in damages to the Congolese state. An appeal against the decision was filed by lawyers representing the three Americans on 17 September.",
