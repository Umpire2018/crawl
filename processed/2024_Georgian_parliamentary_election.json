Opposition leader Giorgi Vashadze issued an ultimatum, calling for the rejection of the bills and the release of those detained during the protests. Amid 2023–2024 Georgian protests|protests in Tbilisi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement, cautioning against the violent change of power in Georgia, with some Russian politicians suggesting Russia might use military means in case of \"instability on the Russian border\". In September 2023, the State Security Service of Georgia claimed to have uncovered plans of the opposition and the Western-funded groups to stage a Coup d'état|coup in Georgia with the support of Ukraine-based Georgian oppositionist politicians. This in turn led to the pro-Russian Georgian opposition Conservative Movement (Georgia)|Conservative Movement party and the TV channel Alt-Info starting to mobilize an \"Anti-Maidan movement\" to counter the alleged coup.",

The leader of the parliamentary majority, Mamuka Mdinaradze, said that the reason for reintroduction of the bill was the continued circulation of slush funds in the country through non-governmental organizations and covert foreign financing of political activities. On 8 April, the Bureau of the Parliament of Georgia registered the bill for the parliamentary discussions. Critics said that the law, requiring organizations and individuals receiving foreign funding to register as \"organizations carrying the interests of a foreign power,\" was a measure to stifle dissent and limit the activities of Non-governmental organization|NGOs and independent media. Protests erupted across the country, with demonstrators calling for the repeal of the law and the \"protection of democratic freedoms\". The government's response to the protests varied, with some efforts to engage in dialogue, while many instances of Police brutality|police violence were reported.\n\nOn 11 May, a record-breaking protest rally took place, widely regarded as the largest in Georgian history. Despite the rain, tens of thousands gathered at four key locations in Tbilisi: First Republic Square, Marjanishvili (Tbilisi Metro)|Marjanishvili Metro, Samasi Aragveli (Tbilisi Metro)|300 Aragveli Metro, and Tsereteli (Tbilisi Metro)|Tsereteli Avenue. Demonstrators marched along both banks of the Kura (South Caucasus river)|Kura, with the four streams of protesters converging symbolically at Europe Square in Metekhi to celebrate Europe Day. Estimates suggest that at least 169,000 people participated, with some reports indicating peak numbers of up to 200,000 or even 300,000.",

Protesters and other critics, including the European Union and Western world|Western countries, spoke out against the bill, arguing that it would stifle democracy and freedom of the press in Georgia and comparing it to the Russian foreign agent law. European Union and the United States officials have been vocal in their opposition to the bill, considering that \"Georgia does not need this law\" and that its passage despite repeated calls from the EU \"to retract such legislation\" was unacceptable. Proponents of the bill denied this characterization, claiming it would ensure transparency of foreign funding and protect Georgia's sovereignty from malign foreign influence. People's Power has argued that the law would protect democracy and the sovereignty of Georgia from foreign interference through financing of NGOs with a goal of promotion of foreign agendas. Some have also criticized the European Union and the United States for interfering in Georgia's internal affairs and undermining its Sovereign state|sovereign power to pass its own laws, and blackmailing Georgia with European Union candidate status and US sanctions in order to maintain their right to interfere into Georgia's sovereign ability through \"unlimited\" and \"undisclosed\" foreign funding of NGOs. They have also emphasized that local NGOs should be grassroots rather than reliant on foreign funding.<ref name=\"sb\"/> at Heroes Square]]",

The Charter, announced during Independence Day (Georgia)|Georgia's Independence Day celebrations, seeks to create a platform for the opposition to present a unified stance. Zourabichvili's proposal emphasizes a new electoral format where voters will choose between the ruling party and a coalition of opposition parties. The plan includes forming a temporary government post-elections to implement key reforms intended to \"enhance democratic processes and align Georgia more closely with European standards\", after which new elections will be held. The Charter's main goals include repealing laws that the opposition considers as hindrances to European integration and undertaking significant judicial and electoral reforms to ensure \"a fair and democratic process\".",

She expressed her support for their readiness to unite and invited them to the Orbeliani Palace on 17 September to complete the final steps of the negotiations. Zourabichvili concluded by asserting, \"I am confident that this is what society expects from you.\" The Georgian Dream MP Giorgi Kakhiani accused the President of allegedly showing her political sympathies towards these parties with her invitation, which he claimed was a violation of the Georgian constitution requiring the President to be neutral. The following day, after a meeting at the presidential administration, Khazaradze acknowledged that while some issues persist, including questions regarding the 2019 protests in Georgia (country)|events of 20 June 2019, and the Anaklia Sea Port project, he and Gakharia are united in their goal to oust the ruling Georgian Dream party. Khazaradze emphasized the critical need for the country to decide between a path aligned with Russia or a future integrated with Europe.",

Gakharia reaffirmed his party's commitment to prioritizing Georgia's democratic path. He expressed gratitude to president Salome Zourabichvili for facilitating the dialogue and highlighted the upcoming elections as crucial in preventing any single party from dominating Georgian politics. On 19 September, For Georgia announced via Facebook that the negotiations collapsed, citing internal disagreements within Strong Georgia. However, Mamuka Khazaradze, refuted this claim, saying Strong Georgia was ready to sign the deal but was waiting for the president's invitation to finalize it. The alliance was intended to challenge the dominance of the ruling Georgian Dream party and the opposition UNM, potentially attracting hesitant voters. Despite this, disagreements, particularly over the former prime minister's controversial past and issues of equal representation on the joint party list, led to the breakdown. On 25 September, Strong Georgia announced that former President of Georgia|President Giorgi Margvelashvili had joined their coalition. Overall, 27 parties were registered for the October elections. On voting day, Zourabichvili expressed hope that the election would bring an end to \"one-party rule in Georgia\".",

The Georgian Dream accused the United National Movement of various \"crimes against the Georgian people\" during its rule, including \"pushing Georgia into the war Russo-Georgian War|with Russia in 2008\" and seeking to embroil Georgia into a \"second front\" of the Russo-Ukrainian War. According to the statement, the existence of the \"collective UNM\", \"which is entirely controlled from outside and is constantly engaged in hostility towards the state\", makes the healthy democratic process and Peaceful transition of power|alteration of political forces \"impossible\". Later Ivanishvili described the \"Collective UNM\" as a \"severe disease\" that has plagued the country for two decades. He asserted that the constitutional majority would enable legal action to ban \"the UNM and its affiliated parties\", citing legal grounds for such a move and comparing it to \"Nuremberg Trials\". He further called the UNM \"foreign agents who are engaged in anti-state activities\". According to Ivanishvili, only when Georgia would replace the \"Collective UNM\" with the \"patriotic political forces\", it would be able to conduct \"truly healthy elections\". Kobakhidze stated the prohibition of political parties is considered a democratic process when there is a legal basis for it. He argued that in a democratic state, such actions are justifiable. Kobakhidze noted that political parties have been banned in Ukraine and Moldova, and similar measures have received positive evaluations from the EU.",

Ivanishvili claimed that the 2008 war was \"a well-planned provocation from the outside against the Georgians|Georgian and Ossetian people, the purpose of which was to split unity, destroy relations and make them exist in conditions of endless, artificial confrontation\". He stated that the 2008 war was \"ordered from outside\" and executed by the \"stateless agents\". He pledged to hold the \"Nuremberg trials\" for the UNM and also said that Georgia would need to apologize to the Ossetian people for \"the flames of fire in which our Ossetian brothers and sisters were enveloped by the traitorous National Movement in 2008\". He said that only Georgian Dream could ensure reconciliation with the Ossetian people. These statements of Ivansihvili proved to be particularly controversial among the public.{{refn| Many relatives of Georgian soldiers who died in the 2008 war, such as the wife of Giorgi Antsukhelidze, who was tortured by the South Ossetian militants, publicly denounced Ivanishvili's statements.}}",

According to the Georgian Dream's statement, given the \"dynamic development of events\", Georgia might get a chance to \"peacefully restore\" its territorial integrity at \"any time\", therefore, \"it will be necessary to amend the Constitution of Georgia to bring Georgia's governance system and territorial state structure in line with the new reality\". According to the ruling party, the \"externally-controlled anti-state\" opposition parties would not be willing to support the restoration of territorial integrity, therefore, it would be necessary for the ruling party to hold constitutional majority. There has also been a fourth issue related to \"protecting Georgia's identity and national values\", however, the statement said that the issue was still under discussion within the ruling party. It was later confirmed that the proposed amendment would focuse on designating Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity as the state religion. The ruling party branded this initiative as part of their commitment to uphold \"national values and traditions,\" in line with their campaign promises to ban \"Gay agenda|LGBT propaganda\" and reinforce the role of the Church. In contrast, the Georgian Orthodox Church has expressed skepticism, fearing that such a change could compromise its independence and increase government control. High-ranking clergy members, including Metropolitan Shio Mujiri and Metropolitan Nikoloz Pachuashvili, have raised concerns about the potential implications of this proposal, arguing that it could alter the traditionally independent yet cooperative relationship between the state and the Church established by the Concordat of 2002|2002 Concordat. After the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) turned down the ruling party's proposal on declaring the GOC as the state religion in Georgia, on 31 August, during the campaign rally speech in Ozurgeti, Bidzina Ivanishvili once again addressed the issue. He confirmed the ongoing discussions between the Georgian Orthodox Church and the ruling party on the constitutional status of the Georgian Orthodox Church. He said that the proposed amendment by the ruling party would clarify the Orthodox Christianity as the \"pillar of the Georgian statehood\" and emphasize its role in the country's history and present.",

It argued that Georgia remains a developing economy because for 30 years (since the dissolution of the Soviet Union) the country \"had been run on free market economic principles\", such as the idea that if state does not intervene in the economy, the market will \"self-regulate\" with \"invisible hand\". Criticizing this theory, the video clip cited China and South Korea as examples of the \"most successful development models\", with them being \"mixed economy|hybrid economies\" in which the state runs and intervenes in the \"strategic sectors\", while otherwise allowing free entrepreneurship. The video clip credited this model for creating and developing \"high-tech industries\" in these countries, such as automotive industry, electronics industry etc. The video clip also argued for increased protectionism against cheap foreign imports to boost local economy and negotiating with Russia to open up its market for Georgian products, which it argued would be crucial for the economic development.",

These amendments change how the chairman and \"professional members\" of the CEC are elected and abolish the deputy chairman role, traditionally reserved for an opposition representative. Under the new law, the Speaker of Parliament, instead of the president, nominates and opens the competition for the election of the CEC Chairman and professional members. Parliament requires a 3/5 majority (90 votes) in the first round to elect candidates. If unsuccessful, a simple majority (76 votes) can be used in the next round, with two attempts allowed. If both attempts fail, the president gains the authority to appoint the CEC chairperson/member. The law also stipulates that CEC members serve a full five-year term, even if elected with a lower quorum. The CEC is composed of 17 members: 7 nominated by the Speaker of Parliament and appointed by Parliament, and 9 nominated by opposition parties. The opposition and civil society organizations argue that these changes increase political pressure on the CEC and compromise its neutrality, violating the European Commission's conditions and ignoring the Venice Commission's recommendations against these amendments.",

The ruling Georgian Dream party justified these changes by claiming that the advisory group was not functional due to the lack of participation from monitoring organizations. Another significant amendment is the change in the CEC's decision-making process. Previously, decisions required a two-thirds majority. Now, if a decision cannot be passed in a CEC meeting, it will be subject to a revote at the same meeting and will be considered passed if it receives a majority vote. The ruling party defends this as an anti-deadlock mechanism. On 16 August, the CEC issued a decree requiring the chairman of each precinct election commission to draw lots to assign duties among commission members one week before the election, instead of on election day. Critics argue this change gives authorities time to influence the election process and threatens transparency. The opposition has challenged this decree in court, but the Tbilisi City Court upheld the CEC's decision. Independent watchdogs and opposition parties remain concerned that these changes undermine the election process's fairness and transparency, particularly ahead of the critical elections in October.",

              "text": "Concerns have been raised about the voting rights of Georgian emigrants. Despite the significant economic impact of Georgian emigrants through remittances, their participation in national elections remains limited. Official statistics indicate that over 125,000 people left Georgia in the past year, while estimates suggest that the number of Georgian emigrants could be as high as 1.6 million. The current voting procedures for Georgians abroad are criticized for being cumbersome, with few polling stations often located only in major cities, making it challenging for emigrants residing in more remote areas to vote. As a result, voter turnout among emigrants has been relatively low; for instance, only 66,217 registered to vote in the 2020 Georgian parliamentary election|2020 parliamentary elections, with just 12,247 actually participating. Various stakeholders, including opposition parties, non-governmental organizations, and president Salome Zourabichvili, advocate for more accessible voting options, such as additional polling stations, electronic voting, or extended voting periods. However, the government, led by the ruling Georgian Dream party, has been slow to respond, citing bureaucratic and logistical challenges. Critics argue that the reluctance to reform the voting process may stem from a political strategy to limit the influence of emigrants, who are perceived as a potentially opposition-leaning electorate. In September 2024, the CEC said that it would open 60 polling stations in 42 countries.",

Georgian Dream was strongest in the rural areas but lost the capital Tbilisi and also Rustavi to the opposition, while being relatively close to losing other major cities as well. Georgian Dream was strongest in the Samtskhe-Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Svaneti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Guria and Adjara regions. In the capital, it received 42% of the vote, while the four major opposition coalitions combined received 46% plus 5.3% of the libertarian Girchi party. Georgian Dream also dramatically lost to the opposition among in the overseas districts among the Georgian diaspora. In Mingrelia, where the opposition parties, particularly the UNM, were strongest in the 2021 Georgian local elections and managed to secure victories in some districts, Georgian Dream managed to turn the tide and won all districts. In contrast to the 2020 parliamentary election, the UNM-led Unity – National Movement coalition declined dramatically, losing half of its votes, partly to the new Coalition for Change alliance, which was established few months prior to the election by former UNM members. The Lelo-led Strong Georgia coalition also managed to improve its results due to inclusion of various small parties in its alliance. Despite this, Georgian Dream failed to attain a supermajority in parliament that would enable them to pass amendments to the constitution banning the main opposition parties. The results were officially certified by the CEC on 16 November.",

MEP Nacho Sánchez Amor, a member of Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, criticized the resolution on grounds that it posed a \"risk of being accused of interference\" by the Georgian government and Russia, with the resolution serving as a proof. MEP Thierry Mariani, a member of National Rally, said that the resolution was aimed to influence the Georgian elections, and possibly causing Maidan in Georgia in case of Georgian Dream victory, while noting that only Georgians should decide their future without the interference either from Brussels or Kremlin. Mariani said that the resolution would destabilize the democracy in Georgia in favor of foreign interests. MEP Petar Volgin, a member of Revival (Bulgarian political party)|Revival party, said that Georgia was being threatened with sanctions for refusing to be a \"Euro-Atlantic puppet\" and \"colony\". He said that the same mechanism was working in other countries too, including in his home country Bulgaria, to undermine a national state and promote globalist doctrines. MEP Danilo Della Valle, a member of Five Star Movement, said that it was wrong to attempt to manipulate Georgian elections by the EU and USA. He also spoke against \"an attempt to impose a certain geopolitical vision on countries, such as Georgia, dictated by NATO and the United States\" amid the war in Ukraine.",

They urged Congress and the Senate to pass the legislation quickly and requested additional resources and congressional visits to monitor the October parliamentary elections, given the critical nature of this support. Conversely, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze criticized the MEGOBARI Act, labeling it as blackmail. He argued that the Act could harm Georgia–United States relations|Georgia-U.S. relations and criticized the approach of using sanctions and threats. Instead, he called for more constructive and pragmatic discussions to improve bilateral relations. The ruling Georgian Dream party issued a statement, saying that the MEGOBARI Act constituted a \"blackmail, intimidation\" against the independent Georgian policy and \"especially cynical\" in light of the Georgian celebration of Independence Day two days before. The party condemned the threat of sanctions against legislators for \"voting in favor of a law\" and added that this was against the spirit of cooperation between sovereign nations. The party rejected the possibility of following the MEGOBARI Act, saying that \"we do not intend to trade on our country's sovereignty and security, and no blackmail whatsoever can force us to go against our country\".",

According to a high-level anonymous source, this marks a significant shift, as the sanctions package is now ready for implementation. However, it is still unclear when these sanctions will be enacted, potentially before or after the elections. One official stated that Ivanishvili had taken steps to deepen ties with Russian oligarchs and worked to increase Russia's influence in Georgia's market, actions allegedly done under the guidance of Russian intelligence. The sanctions would target these activities under Executive Order 14024, which allows for sanctions related to \"harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation\". An additional anonymous source familiar with the discussions told VoA that the administration's efforts serve as a signal to the Georgian government, stressing that the U.S. is serious about its concerns. \"The Joe Biden|Biden people are trying to convey the seriousness and hope that somebody in the Georgian government is listening in a serious way,\" the source explained. While it remains unknown when the sanctions will be implemented, the necessary preparations are in place, with the administration continuing to hope for a shift back toward a more democratic course in Georgia.",

The Assembly stripped Georgia's ruling party of many privileges, including the right to observe elections, and threatened to deny them accreditation entirely unless new elections were announced and political prisoners released by April 2025.

The high voter turnout of about 58% is another indicator of civic activity. The nearly 53% of the vote received by the ruling Georgian Dream, as well as the entry of four opposition parties into Parliament, promises an active period in the country's domestic politics. We trust that it will be conducted in a predictable and civilized manner. This is in the interest not only of Georgia, but of the entire Caucasus region.\" On 28 October, Security Council of Russia|Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev called for the arrest of Zourabichvili for \"calling for a coup.\" \n*{{flag|Slovakia}}: Prime Minister Robert Fico has congratulated Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on victory in the election and expressed readiness to further strengthen partnership.\n*{{flag|Sweden}}: On 28 October, Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation (Sweden)|Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, Benjamin Dousa, announced that the Swedish government would suspend cooperation with Georgia.

However, over the years, Progressivism|progressive Left-wing nationalism|left-wing and nationalist governments emerged and came to power. Last week, they won an exemplary victory with 56% of the votes of the Georgian population,\" Maduro stated.\n*{{flagicon|OSCE}}{{flagicon|Council of Europe}} In a joint report published by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and its OSCE Parliamentary Assembly|Parliamentary Assembly, the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO Parliamentary Assembly|NATO and the European Parliament, the elections were criticized for presence of vote-buying, widespread climate of pressure and party-organized intimidation and pressure on voters, exercised particularly on public sector employees and in rural areas, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution and undermining trust in the outcome of the elections. At the same time, high engagement of Georgian citizens and presence of citizen and party observers and diversity of choices on the ballot was praised. While legal framework was also accepted as adequate for holding democratic elections, recent amendments undermined its stability and \"raised concerns about the potential for misusing the changes to gain political benefit\", while \"effectiveness of campaign finance oversight was undermined by limited enforcement and concerns over the impartiality and political instrumentalization of the oversight body\". In its own report, the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe also reported cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in the rural areas, while the head of the delegation Iulian Bulai stated that \"the presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters led to a widespread climate of pressure and party-organized intimidation and the feeling of 'Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother is watching you'\". PACE's claims of double voting were supported by observers from the European Parliament.\n*Edison Research, which had forecasted a win for a coalition of four opposition alliances through its exit poll, noted that the gap between its predictions and the official results went beyond typical statistical variation, hinting at possible manipulation at the local level. Following a review of the exit poll, the research organisation expressed concerns about the integrity of the reported outcomes. The findings were later echoed by competitor HarrisX.\n*Europe Elects, an internationally respected election monitoring group, conducted an independent analysis of data from the central election commission and confirmed signs of irregularities benefiting the ruling party. The group highlighted a statistical pattern often seen in Russian elections, known as the \"Russian tail,\" indicating a suspicious surge in voter distribution. This finding, coupled with other electoral violations reported by observers, led Europe Elects to conclude that the results of the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election show evident signs of tampering.",

He noted that while \"irregularities happen everywhere\", they were insignificant in terms of final results as \"out of 3,111 polling stations, there had been incidents in just a couple of precincts\". Prime Minister also added that \"of course we have to address these irregularities happening on the day of the election or before\", but \"the general content of the elections was in line with legal principles and the principle of democratic elections\". He also insisted that there is zero space for manipulation with the electronic vote-counting system that was introduced for this election. Kobakhidze accused the opposition of \"lying\" as he claimed they have done during the elections in 2016, 2020, and 2021.\n* Honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili claimed victory on behalf of Georgian Dream.\n* President Salome Zourabichvili publicly stated that she considers the elections to have been \"illegitimate\" and that the country has been a victim of a \"Russian special operation\". She also urged people to organize mass protests starting 28 October at 7 p.m. Zurabishvili concluded her remarks by stating that \"nothing can make these elections legitimate\". Protests were also called on by imprisoned former president Mikheil Saakashvili.\n* Tina Bokuchava, leader of the Unity – National Movement|Unity-National Movement coalition, stated, \"We do not recognize the election results, and therefore, we will not be entering parliament.\" She accused Bidzina Ivanishvili of orchestrating a \"Russian-style operation\" against the Georgian people, claiming he \"usurped\" their victory and disregarded their choice for a European future.\" We were the first to declare that yesterday's election was stolen by Ivanishvili\" Bokuchava asserted.\" This blatant disregard for the Georgian people's will was evident in the orchestrated operation against their democratic choice.\"\n* At a briefing, Nana Malashkhia, the top candidate on the Coalition for Change (Georgia)|Coalition for Change's electoral list, announced the coalition's decision to renounce its parliamentary mandates, refusing to legitimize \"votes stolen from the Georgian people.\" Malashkhia stated, \"We are declining our parliamentary mandates. Today, I am officially renouncing mine.\" Nika Gvaramia further condemned the Georgian Dream, calling it \"the author of a constitutional coup.\" He asserted, \"Under Georgian law, Georgian Dream is accountable for this. But before they face that responsibility, they must recognize the opposition's victory. We have exposed the scheme by which they stole the elections.\" Gvaramia underscored the coalition's unwavering stance: \"Our conclusion, non-negotiable and absolute, is that Georgian Dream cannot continue to rule this country. This is Georgia, not Russia or Venezuela.\"\n* Giorgi Gakharia, Chairman of the For Georgia, declared at a briefing that his party \"will not legitimize the illegitimate parliament of Georgian Dream.\" Responding to whether they would use or renounce their parliamentary mandates, Gakharia accused Georgian Dream Chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili of \"stealing the election from the people.\"\n* Mamuka Khazaradze, leader of the Strong Georgia, rejected the election results, declaring, \"Bidzina Ivanishvili and Georgian Dream, in collaboration with Russian special services, have stolen this election from the Georgian people. We cannot and will not accept these results.\" Khazaradze pledged the coalition's commitment to defending the rights of their voters, stating, \"We stand with our people in the pursuit of truth.\" He encouraged supporters, adding, \"Do not lose heart. This is not over—our fight continues.\"\n* Pro-Russian Alt-Info, a TV channel aligned with the Conservative Movement (Georgia)|Conservative Movement, which was running on the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia|Alliance of Patriots ballot, announced that they would go off air, citing unsuccessful election results.\n* Leader of the libertarian Girchi party, Iago Khvichia rejected the allegations that the elections were rigged, and that his party would join the protests against the election results, claiming that the protests would ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. He thanked his voters for supporting the party in the elections, saying that \"only you were able to make a right choice\".{{Copy edit inline|date=October 2024}} However, in a live broadcoast on their YouTube channel, leaders of Girchi party also highlighted their disappointment with the election results, saying that they were expecting much higher support for their party and crossing the electoral threshold, while not not expecting such large support for Georgian Dream and other opposition parties, adding that they would implement drastic changes in their campaigning.\n*Georgian Labour Party|Georgian Labor Party leader Shalva Natelashvili condemned the election as fraudulent, accusing Russian special services and Bidzina Ivanishvili of deepening divisions among Georgians, fostering hopelessness, and eroding public faith in change. Natelashvili warned that this manipulation is part of a broader plan to demoralize the public, pushing Georgia toward a \"Belarusization\" where elections lose meaning and Georgian Dream remains unaccountable. He vowed to oppose this outcome, stating, \"We will not allow it.\"\n* The Federalists (Georgia)|Federalists stated that \"the 26 October election was neither free nor fair\", asserting that Georgian Dream's results stemmed from intimidation, pressure, blackmail, bribery, and fraud. They noted that Ivanishvili's regime took advantage of opposition groups' reluctance to engage in meaningful debate against its fearmongering about war. They said, \"Our challenges have only grown more complex\", emphasizing that the regime acts as a tool of Russia's hybrid warfare, advancing the Kremlin's agenda to rewrite history and pull Georgia away from the free world, which will ultimately lead to severe sacrifices and a loss of sovereignty.",

On 17 November, protesters calling for new elections established a tent camp outside Tbilisi State University, which was dismantled by police on 19 November. At least 16 people were arrested, including a cameraman for the opposition television channel Mtavari Arkhi. That same day, President Zourabichvili filed a lawsuit at the Constitutional Court of Georgia asking for the election results to be annulled citing \"widespread violations of voting universality and ballot secrecy\". The lawsuit was rejected by the court in 3 December.",
