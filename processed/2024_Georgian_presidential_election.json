In at least two occasions, the Government banned the President from traveling abroad, preventing her from visiting Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and France. In March 2023, the Government announced it would file two lawsuits with the Constitutional Court against the President over her decision to go on an unauthorized visit to Brussels and Paris and over her refusal to sign outright decrees appointing ambassador candidates nominated by the Government, before dismissing the lawsuits several months later. Zourabichvili has increasingly used her veto power against the Parliament, including vetoing bills changing the composition of the National Bank of Georgia, and extending the scope and time limits for covert investigations, amongst other bills, most notably the 'foreign agents' bill.",

Unhappy with the decision, Georgia's ruling party representatives described it as \"blackmail\" and announced in protest that they would cease working in the Assembly.\n* {{Flag icon|EU}} European Union: By a vote of 400 in favor and 63 against, the European Parliament declared that it \"refuses to recognise the self-proclaimed authorities of the ruling Georgian Dream party following the rigged parliamentary elections on 26 October 2024, including the newly appointed President Mikheil Kavelashvili...MEPs continue to recognise Salome Zourabichvili as Georgia’s legitimate president\". The Parliament further declared that it \"considers Georgia as a State capture|state captured by the illegitimate Georgian Dream regime\" and called for widereaching sanctions against the illegitimate regime. Earlier, the European Parliament also overwhelmingly rejected the 2024 election of the Georgian parliament, which subsequently elected Kavelashvili. The European People's Party, the largest party in the EU, described Kavelashvili's election as \"devoid of democratic legitimacy\" and called to \"Recognise Salome Zourabishvili as the legitimate President of Georgia and the sole legitimate representative of Georgia in international relations...\" The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party also explicitly refused to recognize Kavelashvili as president: \"The recent one-party election orchestrated by the Georgian Dream (GD) party, culminating in the appointment of the only candidate - Mikheil Kavelashvili as their ‘president,’ represents a clear violation of democratic norms and an affront to the will of the Georgian people...We reaffirm our unwavering support for Salome Zourabichvili as the legitimate President of Georgia, and do not recognise Mikheil Kavelashvili as President...\"\n* {{Flag|Estonia}}: By a vote of 59 in favor and 9 against, the Riigikogu|Estonian Parliament strongly rejected the legitimacy of the entire Georgian Dream leadership, stating that it \"does not recognise the legitimacy of the Georgian parliament, government, or President who have all been appointed as a consequence of the parliamentary elections that took place in an atmosphere of underhand activities and intimidation of citizens\". The Estonian Parliament furthermore \"recognises Salome Zourabichvili as the legitimate President\".\n*{{flag|France}}: President of France Emmanuel Macron has stated that Russia was involved in \"falsifying\" election results in Georgia and that new elections should be pursued as a way out of the crisis. He subsequently received Salome Zourabichvili at the Élysée Palace with full honors despite her original term supposedly expiring the preceding year.\n*{{Flag|Lithuania}}: President Gitanas Nausėda questioned the legitimacy of Kavelashvili's election by Georgian Dream, stating: \"...no one can take the \"dream party\" seriously, and a person, only elected and acknowledged by his own party, is inaugurated in a semi-secret ceremony...Georgia must either be redefining democracy or skipping the whole parliament and president thing altogether...\"\n* {{Flag|United States}}: Joe Wilson (American politician)|Joe Wilson, Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and Republican Party (United States)|Republican U.S congressman, stated that Zourabichvili remains the legitimate president of Georgia, adding that \"she stands against the illegitimate government trying to foist a Russian puppet president on Georgians.\" On 26 December Wilson wrote on Twitter|X that \"President Donald Trump has made it very clear where he stands on the self-professed enemies of America. If Bidzina Ivanishvili goes through with his plan to destroy Georgian democracy on December 29, he should expect a response like he's never imagined.\" Roger Wicker, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, called on the Biden administration to sanction leaders of the Georgian Dream party and expressed concern that unless urgent action is taken the \"Georgian Dream party could actually forcibly remove the Salome Zourabichvili|democratically elected President of Georgia from power.\" He added that \"Vladimir Putin would like to have Georgia back...willing to rig elections to have his agents brutally repress the peaceful protests...\"",
