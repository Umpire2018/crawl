They were unaware that a fire had broken out on board until they were informed by a cabin attendant that the left engine was on fire, and one of the pilots later said that he had seen an object that had caused him concern before the collision. However, the three pilots denied that they had visually confirmed the presence of the Coast Guard aircraft.\n\nWith the right engine still running, all 367 passengers and 12 crew members on board JAL516 evacuated through three of the plane's eight evacuation slides, located at doors 1L, 1R and 4L. Forty-three foreign nationals and eight children were on board. Two pets, a dog and a cat, were checked in on board and died. Seventeen people on board suffered injuries. It was noted that no one exited with hand luggage, a factor that facilitated a smoother evacuation. JAL's original announcement stated that the evacuation of all crew and passengers was completed at 18:05 JST (09:05 UTC), 18 minutes after the plane collided, but a subsequent investigation by the Japan Transport Safety Board revealed that it was completed at 17:58 (08:58 UTC), 11 minutes after the plane collision. Paul Hayes, the director of air safety at Ascend, a British-based aviation consultancy, told Reuters, \"The cabin crew must have done an excellent job. It was a miracle that all the passengers got off considering the wreckage shown in many images\".<ref name=\"ueno\"/>",

Others were cancelled as the result of the accident, with All Nippon Airways registering 112 domestic flight cancellations for the rest of the day and JAL cancelling 116 domestic flights. Cancellations continued through 7 January, by which time at least 1,227 flights and 221,910 passengers had been affected. The accident reduced Haneda Airport's flight capacity to 70%. In response to these delays, Japan Railways Group|JR group set up supplemental Shinkansen services on the Tokaido Shinkansen|Tokaido, Hokuriku Shinkansen|Hokuriku, and Tōhoku Shinkansen|Tohoku Shinkansen routes on 4 January out to Osaka, Kanazawa, and Hokkaido respectively. These extra services were offered without seat reservations. The clearance operations, which included restoring damaged sections of pavement on the runway, were completed on 7 January. The affected runway reopened to traffic on 8 January. Operations at the airport were expected to fully normalize on 10 January.",

It showed that prior to the accident, air traffic controllers cleared the JAL aircraft to land on runway 34R, while the Coast Guard aircraft was instructed to hold short of the runway at a holding point on taxiway C5. An MLIT official said that the pilot of the Coast Guard aircraft may not have heard the air traffic control tower authorizing the JAL aircraft for landing as at the time, his radio could have been set on the same frequency as that of ground control. Another MLIT official also said that the Coast Guard was not informed of measures introduced by a government task force to prevent airport runway incursions following similar accidents in 2007. Japanese police were reportedly investigating possible professional negligence, including fatigue and staffing levels, that may have caused the accident.",

The report indicated that the captain of the Coast Guard aircraft mistook air traffic control's instruction when their aircraft was told that they were \"number one,\" and entered runway 34R believing that takeoff clearance was given. The report added that neither the controller in charge nor the JAL pilots noticed that the Coast Guard aircraft entered the runway, and that the three circumstances combined resulted in the accident. It also provided details on the evacuation of the JAL plane, and the actions of its pilots and cabin crew.",
