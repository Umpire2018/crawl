After the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a new era of Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalistic sentiments have dominated the Politics of India|political sphere in India. Modi kept a long-standing political pledge of the reconstruction of the Ram Mandir and was seen to have fulfilled the BJP's manifesto to the nation's Hindu population. At the same time, Bollywood productions have been released with themes supporting the Modi government's policies and Hindu nationalist ideologies. In response to such concerns, BJP spokesperson Mmhonlumo Kikon acknowledged the existence of a \"level of threat perception\", but said that the party was trying to change that.",

Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge called Modi's remarks a panic-filled \"hate speech\" and a ploy to divert attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of the election, while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad Adhikar Sena and a non-profit organisation demanding Modi's arrest and for his campaign to be suspended.",

On 18 March, the court ordered the State Bank of India (SBI) to provide all records regarding the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India by 21 March in order to match electoral donors with their recipients and rejected a plea by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India from divulging the identities of donors. Initial reports suggest that among the leading donors to political parties were some of India's largest firms such as Vedanta Limited, Bharti Airtel, RPSG Group and Essel Mining. It also found that the BJP was the recipient of nearly half of all recorded donations.",

In response to allegations regarding the electoral bonds, BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam denied that the party had done any wrongdoing and said that its electoral bonds were gained \"on merit\". However, Indian political observers have reached the conclusion that either Indian businessmen have been regularly bribing their way out of trouble, or that the BJP-controlled government has been using government agencies to extort them. From the data released by the SBI, it was found that companies gave donations around the time they received major government contracts. Close to half of the top 30 corporate donors were facing investigations by government agencies around the time they purchased electoral bonds.",

In a speech to his supporters on 4 June, Modi said that the NDA would form a third consecutive government. Following a meeting with other members of the NDA on 5 June, Modi was formally endorsed to become prime minister again. On 7 June, he was selected as leader of the NDA and was inaugurated as prime minister on 9 June.  On 10 June, Modi unveiled his 71-member cabinet, of which the BJP took 61 portfolios, including foreign affairs, home affairs, finance and defence, while the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United) took two ministries each, with the rest going to other members of the NDA. The BJP's Om Birla was reelected for a second term as Speaker of the Lok Sabha on 26 June.",
