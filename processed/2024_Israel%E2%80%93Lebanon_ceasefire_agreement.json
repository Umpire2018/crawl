              "text": "On 27 November 2024, a ceasefire agreement was signed by Israel, Lebanon, and five mediating countries, including the United States. Hezbollah attacked Israel on 8 October 2023, leading to  Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)|a year of cross-border fighting, and on 1 October 2024, 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon|Israel invaded Lebanon. The agreement mandates a 60-day halt to hostilities, during which Israel must withdraw its forces from Southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah must withdraw its forces to north of the Litani River. A five-country monitoring panel, led by the United States, would oversee the implementation, with 5,000 Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese troops deployed to ensure compliance. Since the ceasefire went into effect, Lebanese sources claim Israeli attacks on Lebanon killed at least 83 civilians, while Israel claims dozens of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the midst of ceasefire violations. On 26 January 2025, the U.S. extended the agreement until 18 February. Once this deadline lapsed, Israel withdrew from populated areas in southern Lebanon but declared that it would temporarily remain in five \"strategic\" Lebanese positions along the border.",

The journalists, including Abdelkader Bay, a video journalist, were reporting from the area when the shooting took place. Bay, along with another journalist from The Associated Press and one from Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik, were wounded by Israeli gunfire. Bay recounted hearing the sound of Israeli tanks withdrawing from the area, followed by the sounds of gunfire directed at the group of journalists as they were filming. Despite clearly being identifiable as journalists, they were targeted by Israeli soldiers. Another journalist, Ali Hachicho, who was not injured, described how the shots were fired as soon as the journalists began documenting the military activities. The incident was condemned by the Syndicate of Lebanese Press Editors, who marked it as the first violation of the ceasefire agreement.",
