Going into the last week of the campaign, each party began to narrow down the electoral districts which were fiercely contested, with their party leaders and executives rallying their support in those districts. The LDP designated about 40 single-seat constituencies with close races as key constituencies. Ishin aimed to retain their stronghold of Osaka, where it faced off against Komeito, while also hoping to expand its support outside of Kansai. The JCP and SDP hoped to maintain its Okinawa electoral district seats and expanded their proportional representation votes.<ref name=\"応援へ\" />",

Ishiba insisted that the funds were not provided to candidates but to the branches as \"activity expenses\", with the party dismissing the report as having \"distorted the facts and caused a misunderstanding\".

While he had ruled out the possibility of forming a coalition with the opposition parties, Ishiba expressed his intention to gain support from Ishin and the DPP through a \"partial coalition\", i.e. case-by-case support for individual bills. On 30 October, the LDP also brought back to its parliamentary group four members whom it had de-selected due to the fundraising scandal: Hiroshige Seko, Katsuei Hirasawa, Yasutoshi Nishimura and Kōichi Hagiuda, who ran as independents and won. Additionally, the party invited two independents who ran against and defeated LDP-endorsed candidates, Satoshi Mitazono and Ken Hirose, to join the group. This brought the LDP-Komeito coalition to 221 seats, 12 short of a majority.",

DPP leader Yuichiro Tamaki said the party would not rule out ad hoc cooperation on certain issues, but would not join the ruling coalition. The party agreed at its executive meeting on 30 October to vote for leader Yuichiro Tamaki, even in the event of a run-off election. In a run-off, all votes not for the top two candidates, Ishiba and Noda, would be deemed invalid, which would benefit Ishiba. Ishin and DPP's proposals which could lead to 70 invalid votes in the run-off, were criticised by CDP Secretary-General Junya Ogawa, who said that the exercise of the right to nominate prime minister was the \"heaviest task\" of a Diet member.",
