One female candidate was elected, the same as in the previous election, while Shia MPs won eight seats, an increase of one. The Islamic Constitutional Movement, a local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, saw its seats decrease from three to one. Eleven MPs lost their bids for reelection. Analysts said that the election result would mean a continuation of the political dispute between Sheikh Mishal and parliament, which during its upcoming term, is expected to rule on the nomination of a crown prince.",
