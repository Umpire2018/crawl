Officials clarified that no dam is present in the region and the closest dam, Matches Dam, was stable. The area lies in a region of the Great Rift Valley that is susceptible to flash floods. The water ministry said the flood carried away the railway embankment and poured downstream at \"a very high speed and velocity\".",
