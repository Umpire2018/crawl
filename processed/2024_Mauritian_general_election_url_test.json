The Electoral Commission reported that some election workers had failed to arrive at their designated polling stations due to fears of further unrest. A consultant for the Electoral Commission, Rabin Bhujun, assured that votes were counted according to schedule. A ban of gatherings within 200 metres of counting centres was implemented until the announcement of the official results.<ref name=nm3/> The SADC mission stated that the election was free and fair. Othman called on political parties to field more female and younger candidates in future elections, noting the disproportionately low number of contestants from these cohorts.
