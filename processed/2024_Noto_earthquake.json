This process began during the Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene the tectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision between the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc|Izu–Bonin Arc and Honshu. This led to reactivation of the rift faults in reverse sense, combined with inversion (geology)|inversion of the basins formed by these faults. Currently Japan is situated on the convergent boundary|convergent boundaries between the Pacific, Philippine Sea plate|Philippine Sea, Okhotsk Plate|Okhotsk and Amurian Plates. Along the island arc's east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west coast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north–south trending convergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been proposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-dipping thrust faults.",

The patch immediately southwest of the epicenter produced a displacement of {{cvt|5.992|m|ft|0}} beneath the peninsula's coast. Another zone of slip occurred further southwest beneath the same stretch of coastline, producing up to {{cvt|6.030|m|ft|0}} of slip beneath Motoichi.

The tsunami swept people away at the entrance of a building and in the park. The locally high waves may be attributed to the seafloor bathymetry concentrating the tsunami at a specific location. Video footage in Jōetsu, Niigata showed the tsunami approaching the rivermouth at 16:35, crashing into embankments and causing seawater to overflow. Evidence of tsunami sediments and marine flora suggested the tsunami reached at least {{cvt|5.5|km}} upstream from the river mouth. It also flowed along the Hokura River for {{cvt|1.6|km}} starting from its confluence at the Seki River. Wave heights along the coast southwest of the rivermouth were between {{cvt|1.5|m}} and {{cvt|5.0|m}}. Northeast of the rivermouth, they ranged from {{cvt|1.8|m}} to {{cvt|4.0|m}}. At Naoetsu beach, tsunami debris indicated {{cvt|2|m}} waves struck while {{cvt|3|km}} to the west in Tanhama beach, waves were estimated at {{cvt|4|m}}.",

The tsunami in Ukai Horyumachi reached up to {{cvt|5.45|m}} and almost every building in the town within a block of the coast was swept away or damaged beyond repair. In Suzu City, many fishing vessels capsized or were carried onto land. Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news helicopter flyover of the city. A resident recalled tsunami waves washing over a road, picking up cars and debris. Ishikawa Prefecture's governor, Hiroshi Hase, said the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to {{cvt|100|m}} inland. A study conducted by professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku University found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain of Toyama Bay.<ref name=\"rupture2\"/>",

A fire occurred in the city at around 17:00. Due to damaged roads, firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames. The fire consumed an estimated 200 buildings, including many homes, and the Asaichi morning market, a 1,000-year-old shopping district and tourist attraction that hosted about 200 stalls. An area of up to {{cvt|48,000|m2}} was affected by the fire, which experts said was exacerbated by the loss of water supply and the tsunami warning, which prevented firefighters from responding immediately to the blaze. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency later said that the fire may have been caused by electrical wiring that had been damaged by the earthquake. At least 516 people were injured in the city. In the city, 3,848 homes were severely damaged or destroyed and 1,754 were partially damaged. Damage and casualties in the city were exacerbated by Noto earthquake swarm|previous earthquakes, most notably a 2023 Noto earthquake|M<sub>JMA</sub>6.5 event in May 2023 which damaged or destroyed a quarter of Suzu's houses. Many people were still residing in these damaged houses at the time of the earthquake. The mayor of Suzu said about 4,000 to 5,000 households of the city's 6,000 were no longer habitable, adding that damage was \"catastrophic\".",

Large holes in roads and landslides made rescue efforts challenging four days after the earthquake. Snowy weather conditions also affected rescue efforts, with snowfall reaching {{cvt|10|cm}} in several areas and raising concerns of additional building collapses. Snowfall significantly affected rescuers' ability to deliver supplies to isolated villages and recover survivors. Power was also cut due to snow, disabling cell phones.",

On 25 January, the Japanese government unveiled a disaster recovery package in which residents were exempted from the cost of demolishing their homes and would receive around $20,000 to rebuild destroyed or severely damaged houses. It also called for the construction of wooden and conventional makeshift prefabricated dwellings. The government also pledged to shoulder up to 75 percent of costs in resuming operations at small and midsized businesses, with a limit of $10 million. It also pledged to support the replacement of affected agricultural machinery and fishing boats, as well as the recovery of traditional industries in the area such as Wajima-nuri lacquerware. The government also said it was planning to shoulder half the hotel fees for tourists in the Hokuriku Region with a limit of $135 per stay to promote tourism. The government said the package would be funded by the national budget's reserve funds in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.",

Preliminary findings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested the temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down Gross domestic product|nominal GDP by 23 to 50 billion yen. Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as Suzu, Ishikawa|Suzu, Wajima, Ishikawa|Wajima and Nanao, Ishikawa|Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic activity. NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to roads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research. However, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less than those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. Tourism in the affected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their bookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million yen ($970,000).<ref name=\"Kurobe\"/>",

He was also criticized for only visiting an evacuation center briefly two weeks after the earthquake. In Wajima, there were over 4,000 registrations for temporary housing units with baths and water heating, of which, only 550 were constructed by mid-February. Only 40 of the 456 temporary housing units in Suzu were completed. Local officials said about 14,000 temporary housing units would be ready by the end of March. Despite reassurance by the government, local residents' confidence remains low due to living conditions in evacuation centers and the delayed response. By the end of February, more than 11,000 people remained in temporary shelters.",
