The riots saw arson, looting and various civil unrests. An estimated, 22 people were killed from the incident.",

The unrest was triggered after police and other public servants staged a protest strike outside parliament on Wednesday, after discovering that their wages had been reduced by up to 50% in their latest pay cheques. In response, Mr Marape said the pay cut was an error due to a computer glitch - which had deducted up to $100 (Â£78) from the pay cheques of public servants. He said the administrative error would be corrected in next month's payments. But this answer was not accepted by many protesters, some of whom then tried to push into the parliament building - with footage showing people torching a car outside the prime minister's compound and overrunning a gate'''.'''<ref name=\"rtl\"/>",
