              "text": "The Persian Gulf region is known for its hot and dry weather, though heavy rains causing flooding have also occurred with greater regularity in recent years. Britain's Royal Meteorological Society stated that the likely cause is a mesoscale convective system. Senior forecaster Esraa Alnaqbi of the UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) further explained that \"a low pressure system in the upper atmosphere, coupled with low pressure at the surface had acted like a pressure 'squeeze' on the air. That squeeze, intensified by the contrast between warmer temperatures at ground level and colder temperatures higher up, created the conditions for the powerful thunderstorm\". Climate scientist Michael Mann at the University of Pennsylvania stated that three low-pressure systems formed a train of storms which moved along the jet stream toward the Persian Gulf. The strong low-pressure system delivered multiple rounds of high winds and heavy rain. Meteorologists from the University of Reading affirmed that the heavy rain was caused by large thunderstorms.",
