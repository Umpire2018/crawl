The measure, which needed the support of at least three-fifths (99) of the chamber's 165 deputies to pass, was approved by 105 members and rejected by only one MP and prompted renewed protests outside the National Assembly that were suppressed by police using tear gas. Two opposition parties subsequently filed an appeal to the Constitutional Council urging it to direct \"the continuation of the electoral process.\" Fourteen opposition candidates also filed an appeal to the council, with two others pledging to challenge the postponement in court. Three lawmakers who were affiliated with PASTEF were briefly arrested on 6 February.",

In response, presidential spokesperson Yoro Dia said that Sall would comply with the decision, but did not give a new date for it to be held. In a televised interview on 22 February, Sall said that he would leave office as scheduled on 2 April, but said that he would hold talks first with political leaders to determine a new timetable for the elections. He also expressed his willingness to release Ousmane Sonko and his supporters as an act of good faith. His proposal for a dialogue was rejected on 23 February by the Aar Sunu Election (Protect Our Election) collective composed of 40 civil society groups, which called it \"unacceptable\" and an \"attempt at diversion\".",

Faye's program is similar with Sonko's for 2019. Faye announced his intentions to implement a monetary reform to finance the economy of Senegal, removing the CFA franc as the country's currency. In his program, he states that he would \"carry out a monetary reform that will allow our country to have its own currency\", however he added that “the creation of a currency requires the respect of the stages of the process”. He added in a press conference that he believed that there was \"no sovereignty if there is no monetary sovereignty.\" After concern from foreign investors, in March he said that he would implement \"monetary reform at the sub-regional level first\", before considering to create a national currency.

This came after the first set of tallies announced showed Faye had won the majority of votes in the first round, triggering widespread street celebrations in Dakar. Hours later, the ruling party's candidate, Amadou Ba, conceded defeat with congratulations to Faye. Reacting to his victory, Faye pledged to \"govern with humility and transparency, and to fight corruption at all levels\", and to devote himself to \"rebuilding our institutions\".",
