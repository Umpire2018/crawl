Manasseh Sogavare, who had previously served three non-consecutive terms as prime minister, two of which ended in no-confidence votes, refounded his Ownership, Unity and Responsibility Party (OUR) shortly after the election. The OUR Party, along with the Kadere, People First and Democratic Alliance parties, formed the Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement (DCGA) bloc with Sogavare as the DCGA's nominee for prime minister. On the other hand, the Solomon Islands United Party, Solomon Islands Democratic Party and the United Democratic Party formed the Grand Coalition; Matthew Wale was the bloc's prime ministerial nominee. The High Court suspended Parliament's vote for prime minister shortly before it was to occur on 24 April, having issued an injunction. However, citing the constitution, Governor-General Frank Kabui ordered the vote to proceed. In response, Wale and the Grand Coalition boycotted the vote while the remaining members elected Sogavare prime minister. Wale then became leader of the opposition. The High Court later dismissed the case against Sogavare's eligibility to run for prime minister.",

In such a scenario, Chinese personnel would also protect Chinese-owned businesses, nationals and diplomats. The full details of the pact were not made public. Reportedly, a part of his \"friends to all, enemy to none\" foreign policy, Prime Minister Sogavare believed that the pact would benefit Solomon Islands by providing the country with more stability, which would attract more investors and result in further development. The opposition condemned the agreement, claiming it would provide more leverage for Chinese influence that would undermine Solomon Islands' democracy. They pledged to repeal it if they were to oust the DCGA government at the election. Two groups, Transparency Solomon Islands and Solomon Islands Council of Women, claimed the pact would not represent the public's interests, that it would effectively cede the country's sovereignty to China and condemned its alleged lack of holistic consultation with Solomon Islanders. Australia, Fiji, Japan, the Federated States of Micronesia, New Zealand and the United States voiced concerns with the pact. These countries, along with others in the region, also feared how the agreement might allow China to establish a military base in Solomon Islands, which both Honiara and Beijing denied.",

As Solomon Islands were hosting the Pacific Games in 2023, Sogavare said the election delay was necessary, arguing the country could not afford to hold two major events in the same year as it was still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 unrest. Many citizens were reportedly sceptical about the intentions behind the delay, which also raised fears of unrest. A survey conducted by Transparency Solomon Islands from 31 March to 1 April 2022 found that 83% of the 2,178 respondents from the public opposed the deferral. The opposition denounced the postponement as anti-democratic and a \"power grab\". Opponents also criticised how the government had rushed the bill through parliament, evading the regular procedures that allow for public input. Opposition Leader Wale said the prime minister had \"succeeded in making [Solomon Islands] the laughing stock of the region, as a country that is prepared to tamper with its own constitution for a two-week event, against the clear wishes of its people\". Sogavare claimed the postponement would not threaten the democratic process and said opponents to the bill lacked evidence that it was undemocratic. marking the first joint elections in Solomon Islands since independence.

The first was preserving social cohesion and national unity to prevent ethnic tensions from rising, as in 2000. Enhancing the nation's legal and governing systems to guarantee public safety was another key priority, as was socio-economic growth; the party pledged to utilise the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, the Solomon Islands Infrastructure Program and China's Belt and Road Initiative. The OUR Party's fourth priority was national defence, security and trade; the party sought to preserve relations with Australia and other traditional allies while expanding ties with China as part of a \"look north\" policy. The fifth key priority was development and land and resources empowerment. During a campaign rally in the Malaitan provincial capital of Auki, Sogavare delivered a speech where he praised the Chinese political system and declared his government's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China to have \"put Solomon Islands on the map\". Sogavare also claimed that democracy leads to moral decline and same-sex marriage.",

Along with the DAP and SIDP, Umi for Change was also a member party of CARE. The CARE coalition released a manifesto on 14 February; issues it highlighted include job creation, infrastructure investment, implementing free education, decreasing the cost of living and creating 25,000 jobs over a four-year period. CARE pledged to implement a 15% pay rise for public servants and enhance the nation's health services. The coalition also promised to address medicine shortages in health establishments nationwide and to ease the overburdened National Referral Hospital in Honiara by funnelling more resources into provincial hospitals. The coalition's leader, Matthew Wale, criticised the Parliamentary Entitlement Commission (PEC), which oversees the entitlements of parliamentarians, for its plans to implement a pay increase for members of parliament. Pointing to issues such as the struggling economy, the healthcare crisis and the poor quality of roads nationwide, Wale described PEC's decision as a \"slap in the face\" to Solomon Islanders and announced CARE's intention to replace the PEC with a High Salaries Commission; intending to monitor the salaries of public servants and provide more accountability and transparency. Regarding foreign policy, Wale announced that CARE would maintain a balanced engagement with foreign countries, including China and the United States. Wale stressed the coalition would ultimately prioritise the national interests of Solomon Islands and ensure that consultation with the public would occur before making foreign policy decisions.<ref name=in/>",

Suidani, a vocal critic of the Sogavare government's switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China and its expansion of ties with the latter, was ousted as premier in 2023 after losing a no-confidence vote, allegedly due to his opposition to the switch. Suidani explained that U4C is a successor to the Malaita Alliance for Rural Advancement government, which he led as premier of Malaita. The Political Parties Commission approved U4C's registration on 9 January 2024; the party subsequently launched a manifesto. One of U4C's key policies included revoking the absolute legal immunity that public officials enjoy. Suidani said this policy was necessary, citing numerous officials allegedly \"hiding behind the law\" and \"making reckless decisions on behalf of the state.\" The party also pledged to address gender inequality and focus on youth-related issues; U4C aimed to establish an education program on employment to decrease youth unemployment.",

The party also sought to preserve relations with traditional development partners, although Kenilorea warned that Solomon Islands should not hold them as the country's sole saviours. The UP called for a diversification of the economy and warned that the country's reliance on limited income streams, especially logging exports, left Solomon Islands vulnerable to external economic crises. Addressing issues regarding critical infrastructure was another priority for the party, particularly the poor state of the roads and bridges.",

The OUR Party and People First Party were later joined by the Kadere Party, forming the Coalition of National Unity and Transformation (later the Government of National Unity and Transformation, GNUT). Shortly before nominations for the prime ministerial election opened, Sogavare announced on 29 April that he would not stand for another term as prime minister and resign as the OUR Party leader, which he said was a \"collective decision\". The bloc instead nominated Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele, who also succeeded Sogavare as leader of the OUR Party. Before the prime ministerial election, Manele's coalition claimed to have secured the support of the independents, providing the bloc with 28 seats. Prime ministerial elections in Solomon Islands are often unpredictable, as MPs are not legally barred from switching parties. Another factor is the vast difference in income and benefits between government MPs and the opposition. The elections for prime minister are conducted through a secret ballot. Although it is held in the National Parliament, it is not a parliamentary meeting and is presided over by the governor-general rather than the speaker. Manele won with 31 votes, defeating Wale, who earned 18. There was one abstention. Two members of Wale's bloc, Francis Sade of the UP and Cathy Nori, defected to the GNUT and voted for Manele. During the first session of the 12th Parliament, on 16 May, Patteson Oti was re-elected as speaker, while Sade was elected deputy speaker. Wale assumed another term as opposition leader.",
