Three thousand SANDF soldiers were deployed to ensure security during the election, while the Independent Electoral Commission said two people were arrested for interfering with voting operations. Julius Malema voted in Limpopo after queuing for three hours. Counting was delayed in several precincts due to last-minute queues of voters, with the last ballots being cast at around 03:00 on 30 May as electoral law allows those still lining up to vote at regular closing time to participate.",

In overseas voting, the DA won 75.23% of the 39,084 votes cast and retained its majority in the Western Cape. The ANC retained reduced majorities in Eastern Cape, Free State (province)|Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West (South African province)|North West and retained largest opposition status in Western Cape, while the DA retained its largest opposition status in the National Assembly. No overall majority was achieved in the National Assembly, nor in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng or Northern Cape, with the MK achieving a plurality in KwaZulu-Natal and the ANC being forced into second-largest party status in KwaZulu-Natal for the first time since it first won the province in 2004. Most of the ANC's loss of support flowed into the MK, while the DA saw some gains, and the EFF lost some support.

On 5 June, the ANC formally announced that it was seeking to create a national unity government, with spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri saying that the party had discussions with the DA, the EFF and three other smaller parties, but received no positive response from the MK. These discussions, which were still in the early stages, will continue, with the ANC framing them as an attempt to form a government of \"national unity\" and not just as an option for a formal coalition. On 12 June, the IFP said that it was willing to join a unity government that included the ANC and the DA. On 13 June, the ANC announced that the DA and several other parties had agreed on the \"fundamental\" principle of forming the national unity government, with a framework to be disclosed on 14 June. On 14 June, John Steenhuisen announced that the DA had entered into a coalition agreement with the ANC and provided its support for Ramaphosa's reelection as president. The Patriotic Alliance also provided its support. This coalition agreement was also confirmed by ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula, who described it as a \"remarkable step.\"",
