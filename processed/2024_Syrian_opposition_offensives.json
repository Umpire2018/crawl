Beginning in 2019, HTS developed a military doctrine aimed at transforming loosely organized opposition and jihadist fighters into a conventional military force. The group established specialized military branches, most notably a drone unit that produced reconnaissance, attack, and suicide drones. HTS additionally established coordination with southern Syrian rebels, creating a unified command structure that incorporated leaders from approximately 25 rebel groups, with the strategic objective of encircling Damascus from multiple directions. HTS initiated the offensive partly to disrupt regional powers' diplomatic normalization with the Assad regime and to counter escalating aerial attacks on northwestern Syria. The group determined that Assad's international allies were strategically constrained, with Russia committed to its war in Ukraine and both Iran and Hezbollah engaged in conflict with Israel, presenting a favorable tactical opportunity.<ref name=\"guardian-plot\"/>",

Speaking to ''Komsomolskaya Pravda'', Semyon Bagdasarov argued that the Syrian government failed to motivate its troops and to unite the various Syrian ethnic and religious groups around its cause. Similarly, political scientist Andrey Kortunov wrote that al-Assad had failed to unite Syrians and achieve national reconciliation, comparing him to former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, who Fall of Kabul (2021)|was overthrown by the Taliban in 2021. Journalist Vitaly Ryumshin shared this comparison, but partially defended the Syrian government, arguing that the lack of reform was due to economic sanctions on the country and loss of control over the oil's resources to the United States and the Kurds. In a different view, Anton Mardasov, a Russian expert on the Middle East, told ''Nezavisimaya Gazeta'' that the government's collapse was not due to Western sanctions but because of al-Assad's failure in dealing with the country's problems, specifically mentioning the economic crisis, endemic corruption and nepotism and \"the loss of touch with reality and thinking in the paradigm of 50 years ago\".",
