This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou's announcement as 'deeply regrettable'. Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou's entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge. Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress {{ill|Lai Pei-hsia|zh|賴佩霞}} (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September. Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers. Gou's campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures. By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened. 7 people were arrested in what was described as a 'signature-buying scheme' a few weeks earlier. On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou's submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election. Amidst the deadline to register with the Central Election Commission, Gou released a statement on 24 November dropping out of the race. In a statement, Gou said \"I'm dropping out, but my aspirations live on.\" He did not endorse a candidate.   \n{{Nominee table\n| party logo         = Independent_candidate_icon_3200001.svg\n| party              = Independent politician\n| president          = Terry Gou\n| vice president     = Lai Pei-hsia\n| president portrait = TerryGou (cropped).jpg\n| vp portrait        = 12／5 ≋ 賴佩霞 ≋ 《轉念的力量》新書分享會，台中場(cropped).jpg\n| experience         = Founder and CEO of Foxconn<br /><small>(1974–2019)</small>\n| vp experience      = Actress, singer, writer\n}}",

In August 2023, amid campaigning, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as vice president, with two stopovers in the United States. Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips. In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company's subsidiaries in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces. Within the final weeks preceding the election, Lai's lead narrowed as the publication of opinion polls ceased.",

It was initially unclear if the KMT's Hou Yu-ih and the TPP's Ko Wen-je would join as a ticket, let alone who would be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.{{failed verification|date=January 2024}} In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the 'only hurdle' remaining in forming the ticket. The order of the joint ticket was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November, but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date. On 18 November, the original deal collapsed following a dispute regarding the polling. The KMT and TPP were reportedly unable to come to a consensus surrounding the margins of error. Despite the initial collapse, there were still attempts to form a pan-blue coalition ticket. Terry Gou, who himself had run in the KMT primary, was informally invited to talks as well.''' ''' A televised press conference between Hou You-ih, Ko Wen-je, Terry Gou, as well as Eric Chu and Ma Ying-jeou took place on 23 November. The press conference did not yield any agreement between any of the involved parties, and was described as \"bizarre\". On 24 November, the deadline for candidate registration, each party announced their own vice presidential candidate, eliminating any chance of a pan-blue ticket.",

TPP candidate Ko Wen-je had historically been opposed to same-sex marriage.

Hou criticized Lai for his lack of a consistent position on capital punishment, which most polls show has been widely supported by the public. At the presidential debate, Lai stated although he was personally opposed to the death penalty, it would remain in place under his administration due to broad public support.",
