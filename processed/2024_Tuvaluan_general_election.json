Several Cabinet (government)|cabinet ministers lost their seats. There were two female candidates, and Dr Puakena Boreham retained a seat in parliament. In the vote for prime minister, held shortly after the election, parliament elected Kausea Natano, defeating the incumbent head of government Enele Sopoaga, who had served since 2013. The defeat of Sopoaga, who was pro-Taiwan, caused some to speculate that the new prime minister would sever ties with Taipei in favour of China. The Solomon Islands, another Pacific Islands country, had made the switch days before. However, Prime Minister Natano later assured that Tuvalu would maintain its diplomatic ties and recognition of Taiwan.",
