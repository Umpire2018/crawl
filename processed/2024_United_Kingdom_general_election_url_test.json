On 18 December 2023, Sunak told journalists that the election would take place in 2024 rather than January 2025. On 4 January, he first suggested the general election would probably be in the second half of 2024. Throughout 2024, political commentators and MPs expected the election to be held in the autumn. On 22 May 2024, following much speculation through the day (including being asked about it by Stephen Flynn at Prime Minister's Questions), Sunak officially announced the election would be held on 4 July with the dissolution of the Parliament on 30 May.",

It pledged to lower taxes, lower immigration, increase funding for public services, reform the NHS and decrease its waiting lists down to zero, bring utilities and critical national infrastructure under 50% public ownership (the other 50% owned by pension funds), replace the House of Lords with a more democratic second chamber, and to replace first-past-the-post voting with a system of proportional representation. It also pledged to accelerate transport infrastructure in coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. The party also wants to freeze non-essential immigration and recruit 40,000 new police officers. Reform UK are the only major party to oppose the current net zero target made by the government. Instead, it pledged to support the environment with more tree planting, more recycling and less single-use plastics. Farage predicted Labour would win the election, but said he was planning to campaign for the next election.",

Key topics were the cost of living crisis, the National Health Service (NHS), young people, education, immigration and tax policy. Sunak said that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax, which Starmer denied. Sunak said this figure was calculated by \"independent Treasury officials\". Fact checkers disputed the sum, stating it was based on assumptions made by political appointees and that the figure was over a 4-year period. On 5 June, the BBC reported that James Bowler (civil servant)|James Bowler, the Treasury permanent secretary, wrote that \"civil servants were not involved in the [...] calculation of the total figure used\" and that \"any costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service\". The Office for Statistics Regulation also criticised the claim on the grounds that it was presented without the listener knowing it was a sum over 4 years. A YouGov snap poll after the debate indicated that 46% of debate viewers thought Sunak had performed better, and 45% believed Starmer had performed better. A Savanta poll published the next day favoured Starmer 44% to Sunak 39%. The debate was watched by 5.37 million viewers, making it the most-viewed programme of the week.",

Another debate between these leaders (also including Lorna Slater) took place on 11 June, on BBC Scotland, hosted by Stephen Jardine. A BBC debate hosted by Mishal Husain took place on 7 June, which included Nigel Farage, Carla Denyer, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Daisy Cooper, Stephen Flynn, Angela Rayner and Penny Mordaunt. The debate included exchanges between Mordaunt and Rayner over tax, and all the attendees criticised Sunak leaving the D-Day events early; Farage called Sunak's actions \"disgraceful\" and said veterans had been deserted, Cooper said it was \"politically shameful\" and Mordaunt said Sunak's choice to leave prematurely had been \"completely wrong\". After the seven-way debate, a snap poll found that viewers considered Farage had won, followed by Rayner, but that Flynn, Denyer and Cooper scored best on doing a good job. Another debate between these leaders took place on 13 June, with Julie Etchingham as moderator.",

The debate covered various topics, including the NHS, the economy, education, immigration, housing and their future plans in government. Starmer started the event by saying he was putting the country ahead of his party, bringing Labour \"back into the service of working people\". He went on to attack the Conservatives on tax policy, saying that \"the Tories are in no position to lecture anyone about tax rises\". 64% of those questioned by YouGov immediately following the debate said that Starmer had performed better, compared to 36% who said Sunak had performed better.",
