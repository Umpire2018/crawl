Individuals were observed keeping watch around the Village Islamic Centre, while nearby shops closed, a hospital sent staff home, and several doctors' surgeries also closed early preparing for potential violence. Several vehicles close to Stechford police station were attacked amid the protest. A Sky News crew was followed by a man in a balaclava wielding a knife who slashed their van's tyre. Before this, the Sky News broadcast from the scene was interrupted by a small group of these protesters, with one shouting \"free Palestine\" and \"fuck the EDL\". The ''Birmingham Mail'' reported that video footage of the incident shows it starting with words being exchanged before one member of the group starts assaulting the man. Others then join in the beating while some try to break up the attack. Sky News' Midlands correspondent Becky Cotterill posted to X the next day that the manager of the pub had told her the man had goaded his attackers by using offensive language as they walked past. He was barred from the pub for \"inciting violence.\"",

In Lewisham a rally was held, organised by Stand Up To Racism and other local anti-racist groups, to \"show solidarity\" with communities targeted by the far right, though there was no direct threat to the area. Some local businesses closed early, and market traders were told by the council to close \"earlier than usual\" ahead of potential protests. This led to some confusion about whether the far-right were also planning to gather in the area, but Mayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres confirmed on the day to News Shopper that there was no intelligence of any planned far-right activity in Lewisham that night. A similar situation happened in Stoke Newington in Hackney, London|Hackney, where SUTR also organised a solidarity rally, although reporting by Hackney Gazette suggests it was because of rumours circulated online that a far-right demonstration had been planned for outside The Old Fire Station on Leswin Road. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on whether it was aware of any far-right action planned in the area.",

Over 2,000 people attended a counter-protest in Old Market, Bristol, where scenes were mostly peaceful despite one arrest after a bottle and a brick were thrown at a police vehicle. Around 500 anti-racist counter-protesters gathered in Westcliff-on-Sea, Southend, to oppose an expected far-right protest that did not materialise. One individual in the area was arrested by police on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon. Hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter following reports a refugee and migrant centre would be the target of a far-right protest. Around 600 people gathered at Magdalen Road in Oxford over fears that a mosque would be targeted. Counter-protests occurred elsewhere in the country, including Normanton, Derby, Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle, Sheffield and Swindon. Smaller gatherings were also present in Accrington and Tamworth, the latter being only a few miles from a hotel which was attacked on 4 August.",

On 12 August, Downing Street confirmed that Starmer had cancelled his planned summer holiday in order to continue to address the violence.",

In the viral video he can be seen walking up to a line of riot police, putting his hands on his hips, and gyrating in front of them. He is then struck in the chest and head by hurled bricks before turning around and walking back towards the crowd. As he holds his head, another brick hits him in the groin. Later that evening, officers were called to a separate incident at which he was present. They took him to Southport hospital to be treated for the head injury, where the police say he racially abused another patient. The officers recognised him from the already widely shared footage and he was arrested.",

The channel had been set up within hours of the stabbing and soon amassed a huge following. It shared details about local protests but quickly descended into making violent threats against named individuals and locations. On 5 August Telegram appeared to remove the channel, which at that time had almost 15,000 members.
