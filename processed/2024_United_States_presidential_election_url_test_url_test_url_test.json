Mr. Trump's embrace of Jan. 6 not only has meant describing the attack in which more than 100 police officers were injured as a 'love fest.' It also has led him to tell a journalist that he wanted to march to the Capitol that day but that his team had prevented him from doing so.}}</ref>",

On January 20, 2025, Trump could order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal charges he is facing, prevent the state charges from taking effect through a variety of methods, and issue a presidential self-pardon. On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court delivered its 6–3 decision in ''Trump v. United States (2024)|Trump v. United States'', along ideological lines, ruling that Trump had absolute immunity for acts he committed as president within his core constitutional purview, at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility, and no immunity for unofficial acts. Thus, Trump's sentencing date for his convictions in New York was delayed from July to September 2024, and then to November 26, and the trial dates in Trump's other cases would likely also be delayed to review the applicability of the Supreme Court's decision.",

The fears came amidst increasing threats and acts of physical violence targeting public officials and election workers at all levels of government. Trump was identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the United States both for and against him. Political violence was at its highest since the 1970s, and the most recent violence came from right-wing assailants. Trump increasingly embraced far-right extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right American militia movement|militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president. Trump also espoused dehumanizing, combative, and violent rhetoric, and promised retribution against his political enemies.{{efn|name=Rhetoric1|Attributed to multiple references:}} Trump played down but refused to rule out violence following the 2024 election, stating \"it depends\". Trump also suggested using the military against \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day that he described as \"radical left lunatics\", Democratic politicians, and those opposed to his candidacy.",

Harris highlighted her work in combating transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers while attorney general. As vice president, Harris announced in 2023 that she pledged of US$950&nbsp;million from private companies into Central American communities to address the causes of mass migration, such as poverty. Harris supported increasing the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents and accused Trump of being unserious on border security. As vice president, Harris also supported a bipartisan bill that would have funded additional border agents and closed the border if too crowded; the bill was rejected by Trump. Trump called on House and Senate Republicans to kill the bill arguing it would hurt his and Republican's reelection campaigns and deny them the ability to run on immigration as a campaign issue. Harris criticized Trump for his opposition to the bill on the campaign trail,",

Trump stated his intention to roll back parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. The implementation of Trump's plans would add around 4&nbsp;billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, also having effects on the international level. If the policies do not change further, it would add 15&nbsp;billion tons by 2040 and 27&nbsp;billion by 2050.

Harris proposed directing $40&nbsp;billion to construction companies to build starter homes, and promised to send $25,000 in down-payment assistance to every first time home buyer. Trump proposed further individual and corporate tax cuts beyond the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump argued that keeping taxes low for the wealthy increases job creation, and that these policies coupled with a crackdown in illegal immigration and reduction in inflation would help the middle class. along with reducing environmental regulation. By October 2024, Musk was Trump's second-largest individual campaign donor. Trump said deporting millions of immigrants would bring housing prices down, although most economists argue it could raise prices by removing construction workers who use less real estate. Trump and Harris support not taxing tips for at least hospitality and service workers. Trump suggested that he would abolish the federal income tax and replace it with tariffs. In June 2024, Trump discussed the idea of eliminating the income tax in a private meeting with Republican politicians. In October 2024, Trump suggested that he would scrap the income tax if he wins, pointing out that tariffs were the main sources of revenue in the 19th century.",

This would be attempted largely through a universal baseline tariff, with increased penalties if trade partners manipulate their currency or engage in unfair trade practices. Trump stated his plans to urge Congress to pass a Trump Reciprocal Trade Act to bestow presidential authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposed one on the United States. Trump's trade policies were described as protectionist, neo-mercantilist, or autarkist, and increasing inflation became a more common critique of Trump's economic plans. In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates signed an open letter arguing that Trump's fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve's independence would reignite inflation in the United States. Moody's Corporation|Moody's, as well as most economists surveyed by ''The Wall Street Journal'' in July 2024, predicted that inflation would be worse under Trump than Biden, a result due in part to tariffs, a crack down on illegal immigration, and larger deficits. Trump incorrectly insisted foreign exporters pay tariffs imposed by the U.S. government; American importers pay tariffs on goods upon arrival at U.S. ports, meaning tariffs are taxes that raise prices for imported products Americans buy. One non-partisan analysis estimated the proposed tariffs would cost $1,700 per year for the average household. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Trump's plans would grow the national debt at roughly twice the rate of Harris' plan, while the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found Trump's plan would only benefit the top 5% of earners.",

Harris was expected to continue deepening American alliances in Asia and the Pacific with the intention of curbing China's rising power both economically and militarily.",

He promised to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" NATO, shifting the country's defense spending from Europe towards Asia. Although NATO members are Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty|obliged to defend any other member who is attacked, Trump said he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies that did not spend enough on defense. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg responded: \"Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security.\" Trump vowed that even before he was inaugurated, He promised to quickly cut the amount of military and financial aid to Ukraine, and make Europeans reimburse the United States the cost of rebuilding its old stockpiles; Trump previously said he might recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, and suggested the 2022 invasion could have been prevented by Ukraine giving up parts of its own country to Russia. Trump promised a tougher stance against China, and at the same time questioned whether the United States should defend Taiwan. Trump suggested withdrawing troops from South Korea if it does not pay more to support American troops there.<ref name=\"Time-2024\" />",

A strong supporter of LGBTQ people's rights, Harris denounced legislative attacks on transgender rights in states across the country. Trump promised to roll back policies regarding transgender individuals. Trump stated he would enact a federal law that would recognize only two genders and claimed that being transgender is a concept only recently manufactured by \"the radical left\". Trump previously withdrew Title IX provisions that allowed transgender youth to have access to the bathrooms of their choice, and he attempted to roll-back several transgender-related policies in the Affordable Care Act. Trump repeated a false claim that children undergo transgender surgery while at school, without parental knowledge or consent. His campaign's \"Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you\" attack ad was the most effective of the campaign, shifting the race 2.7 percentage points in favor of Trump after viewers watched it.{{r|nyt20241107}}",

Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon. Nixon and Trump are the only presidential candidates to win a significant number of electoral votes in three presidential elections since term limits were enacted with the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment; Trump is the only one of those eight that won the popular vote exactly once (Clay and Bryan never won it). Trump is also the first president since Cleveland in 1892 to win non-consecutive terms, and the only president to win non-consecutive terms since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment, as well as the first Republican to do so. Trump improved his percentage of the vote in every state and DC compared to the 2020 election; 2024 was the first presidential election since 1976 United States presidential election|1976 in which all 50 states and DC shifted to the same party. Trump won 49.8% of the popular vote, with a 1.48% margin of victory. While winning the popular vote, Trump did not win a majority of the popular vote, with his final tally roughly a half-percent smaller than Hillary Clinton's national popular-vote margin over Trump in 2016. Thus, Trump is the first Republican since Nixon in 1968 to win the popular vote with a plurality.<ref name=\"Kilgore 11222024\"/> This was the first election since 1944 United States presidential election|1944 in which a presidential candidate won two elections with a different vice presidential candidate, as Trump replaced Mike Pence with JD Vance. This was the third election in which the losing party failed to flip any states from the previous election, in 2012 Romney was able to flip Indiana and North Carolina despite losing. It was also the fifth election in a row in which only one party flipped states; the last time both parties flipped states was in 2004 when Kerry flipped New Hampshire, while Bush flipped Iowa and New Mexico.",

All 50 states and D.C. swung towards Trump from 2020, making this the first time that they swung in the same direction since 1976 United States presidential election|1976. While there had been significant speculation prior to the election of Trump increasing his support among black voters, particularly black men, exit polling data showed only a marginal increase in black support for Trump (from 12% to 13%). Trump's gain was limited by the fact he lost ground among black women, only garnering 7% of their vote, compared to 9% in 2020. While Trump made gains among young voters compared to Republicans in recent presidential elections, especially among young men, exit polls found Harris still won young voters by 51 to 54 percent of voters under 30, leading Trump by 4 to 12 points. Democrats performed better in the downballot races, where they kept Republican margins extremely narrow in the House of Representatives and won Senate elections in 2024 United States Senate election in Arizona|Arizona, 2024 United States Senate election in Michigan|Michigan, 2024 United States Senate election in Nevada|Nevada, and 2024 United States Senate election in Wisconsin|Wisconsin despite Trump carrying those states. Post-election research by the Brookings Institution found that while Trump made inroads with minority voters, the Republican Party had \"hardly\" created a multiracial coalition, arguing that saying so was premature and that such support \"could very well be a blip\" based more on economic concerns.",

Despite this, national polls underestimated Trump a third time, albeit by less than in 2016 and 2020, and within the realm of a normal polling error; most polls going into the election showed essentially a tie, \"within the poll's margin of error\", and thus both Harris and Trump were a normal polling error away from the win, although this did not preclude either Harris or Trump achieving a sweep of the battleground states. In every swing state, Trump outperformed his final polling numbers by around 3%, which is in line with a normal margin of error. In 2016, the national polls were fairly accurate but Trump overperforming the polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin led to his Electoral College victory. In 2020, polls overestimated Biden's margin over Trump by about 4% in competitive states. In 2024, compared to 2020, the margin of error in swing states was less, and high-quality national polls were more accurate. in 2016 and 2020, the Electoral College bias in favor of Republicans was 2.9% and 3.8%, and according to late September 2024 polls it had been reduced to 0.7%, with the unlikely but not impossible outcome of Harris losing the national vote but winning the Electoral College. The Electoral College bias was reduced to 0.2%, as Trump's margin in the tipping-point state in Pennsylvania was 1.7%, compared to Trump winning the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points.",

Newsmax, which also used Decision Desk HQ, quickly followed in calling the election for Trump.  Fox News projected Trump as the winner at 1:47{{nbsp}}a.m., while ABC, the Associated Press, CBS, CNN, and NBC all called the race around 5{{nbsp}}a.m. In a convention center in West Palm Beach, Florida, he was greeted with cheers by supporters, chanting, \"USA! USA! USA!\" when Fox News declared him the winner. Trump claimed victory in a speech to his supporters, where he was joined on stage by his family and his running mate, JD Vance, saying: \"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.\" Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at Howard University, her alma mater. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday. A few hours later, other media outlets also projected Trump elected as the 47th president of the United States, with the Associated Press describing it as an \"extraordinary comeback for a former president\".",

Trump's gains in nearly all geographic areas and among nearly every demographic group provides strong evidence of anti-incumbent backlash.

''The Economic Times'' cited University of Richmond School of Law professor Carl Tobias's appraisal of Trump's stance on immigration winning over Harris', and mentioned how Trump had increased his support from Hispanics, especially near the Mexican–American border and in areas impacted by recent immigration. Harris campaigning at multiple events with former Republican representative Liz Cheney has been suggested as a contributing factor as to why she lost.",

Trump embraced alternative media through podcasts and online streamers such as Joe Rogan, Adin Ross, Theo Von, and the Nelk Boys. ''The New York Times'' reported that such avenues \"presented a way for Mr. Trump to sidestep more confrontational interviews with professional journalists, where he might face tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates. The influencers he met with rarely challenged Mr. Trump, and often lavished him with praise.\" Observers also highlighted Trump's courting of the \"manosphere\", a collection of what ''The Guardian'' described as \"male podcasters, influencers and public figures\" that \"marketed themselves as Freethought|free-thinking pundits who evaded the bounds of political classification\". Post-election research showed that nearly 40% of young voters got their news from social media influencers, and despite claims of conservative censorship, a majority of influencers leaned right. ''The New York Times'' reported that Trump's super PAC had joined a long list of presidential campaigns that made a \"technological leap or innovation\" while targeting key voters. ''The Times'' highlighted the use of targeted advertising of individual undecided voters on Video on demand|streaming video platforms that allowed it to save money, while Harris largely targeted ads on streaming platforms by geography. It reported the Trump team's findings that the undecided electorate was younger, black, and Hispanic, and that such voters largely used streaming media over traditional broadcast television.",
