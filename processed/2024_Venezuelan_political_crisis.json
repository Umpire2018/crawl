Freeland emphasized Canada's long-standing support for Venezuela's democratic opposition and condemned the increasingly authoritarian nature of the regime. In January 2025, Canada formally recognized González as president-elect. The minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly declared: \"Maduro's shameless actions demonstrate that democracy and the rule of law cannot be taken for granted. We will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights.\"",

The opposition said it had collected data from 73% of the country's voting stations on its own and compiled it in a publicly accessible database on Tuesday. Using their national identification, Venezuelans can sign in and review a scanned tally sheet from their voting station showing how many votes went to each candidate. ... 'I found mine, the proof is there,' said Celina Ramirez, an opposition supporter who said she was able to log into the website to locate the tally sheet from her east Caracas voting center, which she said showed González receiving the lion's share of votes. 'There's no way the regime can fool everyone with their tricks,' she added ... The Carter Center, one of the few international organizations invited to monitor the elections, has urged Venezuela's government to release comprehensive polling data at the local level, which is needed to assess the electoral process. ...The opposition hopes the release of the database will increase pressure on Maduro's autocratic regime to make public the detailed results of the election.}} Also available from [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/venezuela-s-maduro-moves-to-silence-opposition-after-disputed-election/ar-BB1qTSWi MSN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240730214546/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/venezuela-s-maduro-moves-to-silence-opposition-after-disputed-election/ar-BB1qTSWi |date=30 July 2024 }}.</ref>",
