Orbán is the only leader of any EU and NATO member state who, despite united efforts by both blocs to support Ukraine economically, militarily and politically, continues to maintain close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in January, the EU threatened to impose voting sanctions on Hungary and permanently cut off its funding if Orbán's government continued to veto a €50 billion (approximately US$54 billion) aid package for Ukraine. This resulted in Hungary dropping its veto and a successful EU agreement on such aid.",

This event has been marked as a major escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In response, South Korea summoned Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev to protest the deal. On 20 June, South Korean national security adviser Chang Ho-jin stated, \"We will reconsider the issue of supplying weapons to Ukraine.\" This statement was also marked an unprecedented change in South Korea's strict military doctrine, which traditionally prohibits sending arms to countries engaged in active military conflicts. Putin warned that it would be a \"big mistake\" if South Korea arms Ukraine.",

Starmer also committed the United Kingdom to raising defence spending to 2.5%, though did not indicate when it would be raised. On the flight to the summit, Starmer reiterated his \"cast iron commitment\" to spending 2.5%. Starmer stated he will lay out a \"road map\", following a “root and branch” review of the country's defences, which officials said will include a concrete date to hit the spending target.",
