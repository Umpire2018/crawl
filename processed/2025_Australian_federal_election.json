The 'Yes' campaign in support of the Voice initially attracted some bipartisan support, including Coalition figures such as the aforementioned Andrew Gee, former Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt, and then-Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians Julian Leeser. However, the National Party came out against the Voice in November 2022, as did the Liberal Party in April 2023.

In August 2023, Albanese announced the referendum would be held on 14 October 2023. 60% of voters, including a majority in all six states, voted against the proposed constitutional changes.",

To prevent the campaigns for the state and federal elections from clashing, the federal election would ideally have to be called after the state election. Accounting for the minimum 33 day campaign period, the earliest possible date for the election would then have been 12 April 2025. Calling the election in early March for that date would have required the 2025 Australian federal budget scheduled for 25 March to be postponed to after the election.",

On 7 March, Albanese announced he had ruled out a 12 April election, and his government would deliver the budget on 25 March as scheduled. This was to prevent the need for Albanese to leave the recovery zone for Canberra to call the election, and to also prevent the announcement and start of an election campaign from clashing with dealing with the cyclone and recovery efforts. With the following April Saturdays of 19 April and 26 April coinciding with significant nationwide long weekends, i.e., the Easter and Anzac Day public holidays, holding an election on those days would likely be problematic and unpopular. That left the Saturdays of 3 May, 10 May or 17 May as the only remaining possible dates. Though, out of these, 3 May coincides with a long weekend in Queensland and the Northern Territory for Labour Day and May Day, respectively.",
