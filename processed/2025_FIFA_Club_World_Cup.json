In May 2024, FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum published a letter they sent to FIFA that calls on a rescheduling of the tournament as well as a reform to the FIFA International Match Calendar to give players more time to rest between major competitions, which have also seen expansions. The organizations also stated in the letter that they would advise member clubs to seek legal action or other options in the event that schedule congestion is not addressed. On June 13, 2024, FIFPRO announced that England's Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and France's  Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels (UNPF) submitted a legal claim with the Commercial Tribunal (Belgium)|Business Court in Brussels to protest the tournament. FIFPRO has warned throughout 2024 that if a compromise is not reached about the Club World Cup, their players may organize a strike. On January 30, 2025, Infantino and FIFPRO met to discuss fixture congestion.",

Alajuelense would have been the first team eligible to qualify via CONCACAF's ranking pathway, given the restriction of two clubs per association. However, this assumes the host slot is counted toward the association restriction; otherwise American club Philadelphia Union would be the first eligible team via the ranking pathway. On February 4, 2025, Alajuelense filed an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport against FIFA, Pachuca, and León. Ultimately the case against Grupo Pachuca was successful and León was removed from the tournament on March 21, 2025. According to ''The Guardian'' and confirmed by FIFA, the likely replacement will come in a one-game playoff ahead of the tournament between 2023 CONCACAF Champions League runner-up Los Angeles FC and the highest-ranked by coefficient Mexican club not already in the tournament, Club América, should Leon's expulsion be confirmed. Notably, this excludes both Liga Deportiva Alajuelense|Alajuelense and Philadelphia Union. Currently, there is an expedited appeal hearing regarding Leon's expulsion scheduled for the week of May 5, 2025. Separately, and subject to the confirmation of Leon's potential removal, Alajuelense's case is scheduled to be heard on April 23, 2025 in Madrid.",
