Attempts to reach a ceasefire were raised at the United Nations Security Council in October; Israel requested the resignation of United Nations secretary-general António Guterres after he referred to Israel's retaliation as unjustified collective punishment. After Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip (2023–present)|Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu rejected a ceasefire, equating a halt in fighting to a surrender to Hamas and terrorism. United States secretary of state Antony Blinken presented \"humanitarian pauses\" to countries in the region but stated a ceasefire would allow Hamas to initiate a second attack on Israel. An agreement was nearly reached, but forfeited after Israel's invasion of Gaza.",

Biden urged Egypt and Qatar to pressure Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and the release of hostages. On 7 April, Israel withdrew the 98th Paratroopers Division from Khan Yunis, significantly reducing Israel's presence in southern Gaza. According to Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant, the withdrawal was intended to reallocate resources towards a planned invasion of Rafah.",

Hamas insisted it will only release the hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire, but Israel said it would only agree to a temporary one. Palestinians also demanded that Gazans be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza, which Israel rejected. Hamas rejected the proposal for temporary truce, and once again demanded a permanent ceasefire. On 15 April, a senior US Congressman Steny Hoyer threatened that the US \"will reevaluate its relationship with Qatar\" if it doesn't pressure Hamas to release the hostages. Qatar responded by saying it will reevalutate its role as a mediator. On 18 April, CIA Director Burns blamed Hamas for lack of a deal, pointing out that Gazan civilians would get some humanitarian relief under the current proposal. On 26 April, Hamas repeated that it was \"serious\" about a deal, but only if it included a permanent ceasefire.",

On 1 May, Hamas rejected the Israeli proposal, but promised to make a counter-proposal, while also saying that Israel's Rafah invasion could put the talks in jeopardy. On Telegram (software)|Telegram, Hamas chief political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on 2 May the organization viewed the proposal with \"positive spirit\" and planned to send a delegate to Egypt. According to a text message obtained by ''The New York Times'', former Hamas military leader Husam Badran wrote two days later the organization's representatives approached Israel's proposal with \"great positivity\". Discussions stalled by 5 May in a purported \"crisis\" over the duration of a ceasefire; Hamas requested a permanent ceasefire, while Netanyahu was open to only a temporary ceasefire.",

The following day, Hamas and Islamic Jihad replied to the resolution with amendments to the proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and troop withdrawals, and the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister stated, \"The claim that Israel agreed to end the war before achieving all its goals is a total lie\". The United States responded to the Palestinians' proposed amendments by calling them unworkable. The day after that, Hamas denied adding any new ideas to the ceasefire proposal. On 21 June, Hamas stated, \"The priority is to stop the criminal war on our people\", and three days later, Netanyahu stated Israel would only accept a partial ceasefire that would not end the war.",

''Yedioth Ahronoth'' stated that Netanyahu had sabotaged a hostage ceasefire deal in July 2024 by adding a number of additional last minute demands. A report by U.S. authorities privately acknowledged in mid-September 2024 that the Biden Administration would fail to negotiate a ceasefire before the end of its term. According to unnamed U.S. officials, Biden believed Netanyahu did not want a ceasefire and was rather extending the conflict to help both himself and Trump politically.",
