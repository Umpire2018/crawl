The estimated cost to rebuild Port Vila, the nation's capital, and other areas affected by the earthquake is 29 billion vatu ($374 million). Additionally, efforts to rebuild following the earthquake only adds to the list of other disasters for which the country needs to rebuild, namely three tropical cyclones in 2023, an airline collapse, and the economic impact of COVID. Fears regarding the safety of an ability to travel may also have effects on the results. In addition to the injuries caused by the earthquake and the loss of personal property, more than 110 classrooms across 45 schools have also been damaged. Moreover the Port Vila Central Business District remains closed. This could impact whether people feel safe to travel on damaged roads to new polling locations and whether they have the fares required to travel by bus.",

Within the 18 months prior to the snap election, Vanuatu has experienced three Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Ministers. The Vanuatu Parliament experienced a series of \"floor crossings\" by members of parliament which led to levels of uncertainty. In an effort to prevent this from occurring, and thereby preserve political stability, Vanuatu held a referendum in 2024 Vanuatuan constitutional referendum|May 2024 adopting two new constitutional provisions. The first would force a member of parliament who leaves or is expelled from the party under which they were elected to resign their seat which would then be filled by a by-election. The second would require elected independents and individuals elected as the only member of their party to join a larger party represented in parliament within three months of the first session. Both measures passed by large margins. Understanding the frustration regarding political instability, some candidates have run on a platform to end political instability with independent candidate Mike Esrom Kaun stating \"[p]eople are frustrated, are tired and realize that something has to happen and this has been amplified by the disaster that recently happened.\"",
