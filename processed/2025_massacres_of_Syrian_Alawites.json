In his speech, al-Sharaa said that \"remnants of the former regime\" had no choice but to surrender immediately as he vowed to hold accountable \"anyone involved in civilian bloodshed\". He later vowed to punish anyone involved in the killings, saying that Assad loyalists and associated foreign powers committed the killings as means to destabilize the Syrian state and restart civil war. His office stated that it would create an independent committee to determine culpability for the violence. On 10 March 2025, the Syrian government announced the end of counter-insurgency operations after expelling pro-Assad insurgents from \"vital centres\" and re-establishing control over most of the roadways in the coastal region.",

It said these killings occurred in the specific locations of Al-Shir, Al-Mukhtariya, and Al-Haffah. SNHR also said about 40 civilians were executed together in al-Mukhtariya. ''The Guardian'' said it was unable to independently verify the video, Reuters reported that location-verified imagery from the town showed approximately 20 men, many visibly bloodied, lying alongside one another along a roadside in the town center. Multiple sources released footage showing deceased individuals in civilian attire collected in a residential courtyard, with blood visible in the vicinity and women audibly mourning. Additional video evidence reportedly showed armed individuals in military uniforms directing three people to move on the ground before shooting them at close range. The SOHR distributed these recordings, as did local activists; Agence France-Presse|AFP said it was unable to verify them. Two videos showing a car dragging a body in Latakia were verified by the BBC. People gathered outside a Russian air base near Jableh seeking protection.<ref name=\"ap7march\"/>",

The SOHR said that sources had told it that authorities were restricting the movement of relief teams and humanitarian aid into coastal cities affected by violence. The SOHR characterized the access limitations as \"part of a systematic effort to conceal evidence of war crimes and genocide,\" arguing that restricting journalists' movements represented \"a systematic policy to obscure the facts and prevent documentation of violations.\" The organization said that the isolation of the sites of the massacres from the international community would \"paves the way for forced demographic change and the Tampering with evidence|obliteration of evidence of crimes against humanity.\" It expressed concern that the combination of media restrictions and limitations on humanitarian access could exacerbate suffering in affected communities, while simultaneously reducing international awareness of and response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.",

It said the campaign appeared designed to complicate attribution of responsibility by suggesting that violence was occurring on all sides at the site of the massacres in order to help government forces evade responsibility, and that the campaign appeared to try to influence foreign governments' and organizations' understanding of events to minimize international intervention, and to create an impression of popular support for actions against Alawite communities in Damascus. The SOHR said that these narrative manipulation efforts sought to \"obscure the truth about the genocide being perpetrated against the Alawites in the Sahel [coastal region],\" potentially undermining accountability mechanisms for those responsible for violence. The observatory also condemned the lack of effort in stopping \"hate speech and Incitement to genocide|incitement to murder\" since the fall of Assad.",

She emphasized that the Syrian government's failure to immediately act and carry out effective investigations without bias or favoritism would invigorate further acts of violence by parties with impunity. She believed that there would be no reason for Syrian civilians to trust any findings of the government if the process was not fully Transparency (behavior)|transparent or not conducted with independent international organizations. She stated that President al-Sharaa's words vowing justice against perpetrators would mean little without the participation of victims, an upholding of equal human rights for all communities, and for making sure that \"never again really means never again\". In a separate statement dated 3 April 2025, the organization stated that it had investigated 32 of the killings and concluded that they were deliberate, targeted at the Alawite minority sect, and unlawful. The organization added that such deliberate killings constitute war crimes and urged the Syrian government to ensure prompt, independent, and effective investigations, hold perpetrators accountable, and end discriminatory targeting based on sect.",
