Many Islamic Courts Union affiliates had been killed during the invasion, leaving a vacuum for the small group of several hundred youth that served as the ICU's Shabaab militia to gain prominence. During the military occupation, Al-Shabaab garnered substantial support from the Somali population, cutting across clan lines. The Ethiopian invasion was the groups primary catalyst for mobilization among the population. Despite its strict ideology, the group was widely perceived as a genuine resistance force against Ethiopian occupation by many Somalis, and while not universally popular, it was widely acknowledged for its effective training and formidable capabilities in pushing out Ethiopian troops. Heavy handed tactics and blatant disregard for civilian life by Ethiopian troops rallied many Somalis to support the Al-Shabaab as it successfully branded itself as the most determined and uncompromising resistance faction.",

A member of the Somali Parliament, Mahad Dore, confirmed the attack and that civilians were killed. After Amnesty International accused the US military of providing no accountability for civilian victims of airstrikes, Africom's commander announced on March 31 that quarterly reports detailing civilian death allegations would be included in the future, along with investigation progress of those claims.
