Several rebel groups were present in Idlib, including the Islamist rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (which broke away from the Al-Nusra Front), the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, and dozens of smaller nationalist and Islamist opposition groups which largely operate in a shared command with larger groups. In Southern Syria, the opposition consisted mostly of demobilised fighters who had undergone reconciliation through previous cease-fire agreements and subsequently conducted local insurrections as Government forces withdrew in early December. An additional American-backed Syrian Free Army opposition force controlled a section of desert around the post of al-Tanf.{{cn|date=February 2025}}",

Upon returning home, however, he lied to his senior commanders and advisors, claiming that Russia would soon send aid. His wife Asma al-Assad|Asma had already been in Moscow for cancer treatment for months, accompanied by their children. A few days later, the rebels captured Aleppo. Afterward, reports emerged of a coup led by Syrian State Security Director General Hossam Louka against the Assad government. The Syrian Army General Command as well as the Iranian ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbari, both denied these reports. On 2 December, Assad met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to discuss the situation. He confided that the Syrian Armed Forces were too weak to offer effective resistance to the continuing rebel advance. Regardless, he did not request increased Iranian aid, probably due to concerns about an Israeli intervention. At this point, the Syrian President had possibly concluded that the war was already lost. Despite this, he continued to tell his inner circle that Russian support would be coming, imploring them to continue their work.<ref name=\"reuters\" />",
