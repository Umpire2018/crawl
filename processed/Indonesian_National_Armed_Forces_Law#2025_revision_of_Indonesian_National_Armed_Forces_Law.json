The law repealed a number of armed forces laws enacted in the 1950s and was intended to set the guidelines for the armed forces and its branches, including the police, and established the Total People’s Defense and Security System (Sishankamrata, ''Sistem Pertahanan dan Keamanan Rakyat Semesta''). The law also codified the ''Dwifungsi'' doctrine, the armed forces' dual function as a defense force as well as a dominating force in social and political affairs.",

The armed forces commander, L. B. Moerdani, stated that the law was a direct continuation of the Law No. 20 of 1982 on Defense and Security Principles. The draft law proposed in the conference included a detailed elaboration on Sishankamrata as well as increasing the retirement age of flag officers from 55 to 60 years, which was based on the increase in the quality of life and followed the examples of Thailand and the United States. Moerdani himself proposed the bill to be enacted on 19 December that year, in time for the 39th anniversary of the Second Dutch military offensive and the inauguration of the armed forces new headquarters in Cilangkap. However, the deadline was scrapped due to time constraints, with the bill’s special committee chairman A. A. Baramuli describing the deadline as impossible to fulfill.",

The second hearing on the stance of each faction in the House of Representatives was held on 2 December, which was followed by the government's response in an open session eight days later.

A new doctrine, which was named the new paradigm, dismantled the non-military functions of the armed forces. In light of the new paradigm, a number of new legislations were made to enforce the new doctrine. These legislations, according to Director-General of Defense Resources Rear Admiral Darmawan, mandated the existence of an armed forces law.",

After the armed forces finished drafting the bill, the bill was scrutinized by the defense department's legal bureau and was examined by other departments. During the course of the scrutiny process, there were several articles that became a subject of focus, such as article 19 regarding the deployment of armed forces in the time of emergency, which did not require the consent of the president. The bill faced protests from various groups such as Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, the Union of Indonesian Nationalist Students, the People's Democratic Party (Indonesia)|People's Democratic Party, and a coalition of 31 non-governmental organizations, due to it being perceived as an attempt to return to the old ''dwifungsi'' doctrine. Defence analyst Philips Jusario Vermonte stated that the bill reflected the \"failure of [civilian] control over the military\", while Bambang Wisudo, writing for ''Kompas,'' described the bill as \"contradictory to the will to create a reliable defense force under the control of democratic civilian authorities\". Due to this controversy, various non-governmental organizations which were initially involved in the discussion of the bill were left out by the government. A working group established by the Department of Defense to discuss the law in 2002 became dormant around the same time.",

The bill defines the armed force's identity based on historical factors, which contradicts the People's Consultative Assembly decree that defines the armed forces as a modern, professional army aligned with humanitarian law. Edy demanded the government's explanation on the draft produced by the working group and urged the House of Representatives to scrutinize the bill and involve as many non-governmental organizations as possible. Prihartono stated that the bill lacks clarity on the armed force's role in the legal system and its authority within a democratic civilian government, failed to reflect efforts to build professionalism within the armed forces, and could potentially revive the ''dwifungsi''. and armed forces commander Endriartono Sutarto urging the experts \"not to fool the public\".",

The National Awakening Party faction submitted an alternative bill, which placed the armed forces under the Department of Defense and merged all levels of territorial commands into a single regional defence command ({{Langx|id|Komando Daerah Pertahanan}}). The bill was eventually passed as law on 30 September 2004 with minor revisions from the original coordinating minister's draft It was the last bill passed by the 1999—2004 period of the House of Representatives before it went out of office the next day.
