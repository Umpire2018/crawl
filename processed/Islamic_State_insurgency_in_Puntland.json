The assault began with a SVBIED|suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED) targeting the supply camp, causing both casualties and material damage. This was shortly followed by another SVBIED, which included two suicide bombers, targeting the main camp. After the initial explosions, the remaining Inghimasi|Inghimāsīyyūn began engaging Puntland Dervish Force|Puntland forces for several hours until they were eliminated. Puntland Dervish Force|Puntland forces said they had killed 8 fighters and had \"foiled\" the attack. Following the attack, multiple videos and images were released by reporters showing a collapsed building resulting from the SVBIED blasts, several burned-out vehicles, and the bodies of the Inghimasi|Islamic State fighters. Amaq News Agency|Amaq later released a report stating to have killed 20+ Puntland Dervish Force|Puntland forces and wounded over 10, and inflicted significant material damage, which aligned with what had been reported. Puntland's claim of foiling the attack was questioned by some security analysts, as the role of an Inghimasi|Inghimāsīy is to inflict as much damage as possible, expecting to be killed. Given that the Islamic State – Somalia Province|Islamic State successfully achieved this objective, it could be seen that the Dharjaale assault was a victory for tIslamic State|he Islamic State. This attack was the first of its kind in terms of scale and sophistication for the Islamic State – Somalia Province|Islamic State in Somalia, occurring just after Puntland announced a major offensive against both the Islamic State – Somalia Province|Islamic State and Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab. Said Abdullahi Deni|President Said Abdullahi Deni has been actively involved, meeting with security officials in Bosaso to prepare for this campaign. The offensive is seen as part of a broader strategy to eliminate the Islamic State – Somalia Province|Islamic State presence in the Outline of Puntland|region, with some implications for Islamic State operations in Western & Central Africa.",
