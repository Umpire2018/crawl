Although she intended to record a speech, she did not have the opportunity to do so. Reports indicated that in a meeting with security officials on 4 August, Hasina insisted on staying in power by using force against what she called \"terrorists\". However, military leaders warned her that the country would be approaching a civil war if they fired on the protesters. As she was determined to stay, the military leaders met her again on the next morning and concluded that her safety could no longer be guaranteed as protesters were soon to reach the Ganabhaban. Senior police officers had also warned her that their forces were running out of ammunition. She finally agreed to resign after talking to her close relatives. Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, later said that his mother had begun considering resignation as early as 3 August but was only convinced to do so by close relatives who had been approached by senior military and police officials, according to media reports.",

AJAX1431 switched off its transponder at around 17:00 local time over Lucknow, rendering the aircraft untraceable. Shortly, she was reported to have landed at the Hindan Air Force Station in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of the Indian capital New Delhi, and was reportedly received by the Indian National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval at the base. Her arrival in Delhi was subsequently confirmed by Indian Minister of External Affairs (India)|Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar.

He further noted that members of opposition parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami, were involved in protecting Hindu temples and homes from potential attacks. But the incumbent General Secretary of the group dismissed his statement as a lie, claiming that he was expelled from the organisation and became the president of the same organisation again after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government.

Shortly thereafter, Wazed refuted the statement as \"completely false and fabricated,\" emphasizing that Hasina \"did not make any statement before or after leaving Dhaka\". On 12 August, the Rumor Scanner Bangladesh investigated the matter and declared the reports about Sheikh Hasina's statement as fake and rumour. On 13 August, Hasina released her first confirmed statements since her overthrow, published by Wazed, calling for an investigation into the killings during the protests. She also insisted that the police and the Awami League were victims of \"terrorist aggression\".",
