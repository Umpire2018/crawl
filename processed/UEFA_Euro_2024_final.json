In the opening exchanges, while England prevented Spain from getting a shot on target, they also saw little of the ball and struggled when on it, while Spain appeared more settled and were able to play through the lines. England then started to play better for a period after the fifteenth minute, with opportunities created by Bukayo Saka. Targeting the same area, behind Spanish defender Marc Cucurella, England won the ball in the 21st minute but quickly lost it again under pressure from Dani Olmo. Olmo sent the ball over to Lamine Yamal, who had been quieter up to this point with Spain attacking on the other side.

Gary Neville said \"it feels like a never-ending story where we just can't get over the line\" and described a sense of \"rinse and repeat\" of England failing to keep the ball well enough at major championships. Spanish football journalist Guillem Balagué praised Spain manager Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)|Luis de la Fuente for winning the competition with players he had managed to under-19 and under-21 titles in the 2010s. adding \"these players have made history and they still have a long way to go\" and that \"this group can keep growing because they do not tire of hard work, competing and trying to win.\" Spain match-winner Mikel Oyarzabal said he was lucky enough to give the victory, adding \"I have done my job. I did what I had to do at every moment to try to help\", while defender Marc Cucurella added: \"We deserved it from the start. Not many people backed us, but we kept quiet and did our job, which is to play football.\"",

Immediately after the game, Southgate said that he could not answer whether it would be his final match. Captain Harry Kane said they had done well to get back into the game, adding \"We could have used that momentum to push on\", concluding: \"It's as painful as it could be in a football match.\" King Charles III congratulated the England team in a letter addressed to Southgate, calling it \"a really great achievement in itself\" to reach the final.
