In a report in the ''Journal on Active Aging'', doctors noted he had an \"exceptional health profile\" relative to his age, and a medical assessment performed by physician Kevin O'Connor (physician)|Kevin O'Connor attested to his physical acuity. ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s Dan Zak described the U.S. government as a \"gerontocracy\" with Biden's inauguration. On July 28, 2022, U.S. Representative Dean Phillips became the first incumbent Democratic member of Congress to say President Biden should not run for re-election and called for \"generational change,\" pointing to Biden's age. Phillips argued during his campaign that President Biden would be a weak general election candidate due to his age and low approval ratings. In public, Phillips was ridiculed. In private, others in the Democratic Party shared his concerns. In late January or early February 2024, Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, received a call from a Democratic senator where the senator reportedly told him that, \"You do realise, off the record, that Joe Biden is not going to be our nominee?

Phillips honed in on the parts about Biden's age when he stated that Hur's report “simply affirms what most Americans already know and all but handed the 2024 election to Donald Trump” if Biden is the Democratic nominee.",

A parallel Abandon Biden movement grew urging Biden to drop out of the presidential race. The uncommitted vote was the largest opposition to the Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign and received higher vote totals than many contenders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, including Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, and Biden's vice president Kamala Harris.

However, images of him looking frail exiting from Air Force One on the way to isolation at his residence in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, fueled further speculation over his health. ''The New York Times'' reported that Biden was \"more receptive\" to withdrawing his nomination. In phone conversations, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden she was pessimistic about his candidacy. On July 18, ''Axios (website)|Axios'' reported that Democrats believed Biden would exit the election, citing pressure from Jeffries and Schumer, internal polling, and criticism. ''The New York Times'' reported that day that Biden was considering that he may have to withdraw. CNN reported that on July 20, Biden met with advisors Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, during which they concluded that worsening poll numbers and a loss of party support had left the campaign without a plausible strategy to recover. That evening, Biden began planning a possible exit from the race with Ricchetti, Donilon, and other close aides, and he fully committed to the decision on the morning of July 21. On August 3, the ''Minnesota Star Tribune'' reported that 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries|primary challenger US Representative|Representative Dean Phillips said, \"If people write anything, I just hope that they might write if [Biden] had debated me then and he had been on one stage, unscripted, with a national audience, and he demonstrated that decline then, this would have been very different circumstances.\" He continued, \"And that's what I was trying to do.\"",
